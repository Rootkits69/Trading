veryone tries to learn everything in
0:01
ICT in order to become profitable but
0:04
what you should be doing instead is
0:05
mastering the one concept that IC built
0:08
everything around and that concept is
0:11
liquidity because liquidity tells you
0:13
everything you may be wondering how
0:14
there are so many other Concepts how
0:16
could I possibly learn everything with
0:17
just liquidity well the answer to that
0:19
comes down to a few things so why I say
0:21
that is that liquidity tells you how to
0:23
find bias tells you how to confirm the
0:25
bias and it tells you how to execute
0:27
trades and at the end of the day if you
0:29
can m these three things the only thing
0:32
that you have left to master is your
0:34
psychology and your risk management
0:35
because pretty much everything that
0:37
you're doing in trading on the chart
0:39
comes down to one of those three things
0:40
which way is the market going do I have
0:42
a very high conviction in that and where
0:43
am I going to place a trade if something
0:45
doesn't directly help you find that then
0:47
it is noise and it's going to distract
0:49
you from what matters so instead of
0:50
focusing on a 100 different concepts in
0:52
today's video I'm going to show you how
0:53
you can master all of ICT using the
0:56
original concept that he built
0:58
everything around which is liquidity in
1:00
liquidity as an ICT Trader is pretty
1:02
much like a superpower and if you master
1:04
liquidity then you're going to be like
1:05
this guy this guy definitely is a
1:07
profitable Trader all right in all
1:08
seriousness though liquidity can tell
1:10
you everything in this video I'm going
1:11
to show you exactly how now let's take a
1:13
look at how and get right into this so
1:15
liquidity alone can transform you from a
1:17
struggling Trader to a profitable Trader
1:19
because half of the time whenever you're
1:21
on your charts and you're not able to
1:22
execute and you're not able to stay
1:24
consistent the reason is because you
1:25
don't have a very simple system that
1:27
you're confident in but once you
1:28
eliminate all the noise and you're just
1:30
focusing on one thing spotting trades
1:31
becomes easy and everything just falls
1:33
into place now the next reason is that
1:35
all ICT Concepts revolve around
1:38
liquidity every other concept that has
1:40
been over complicated or repackaged from
1:42
ict's original teachings into all these
1:44
complex strategies it all just comes
Liquidity
1:46
down to liquidity and none of the
1:48
concepts work well if liquidity isn't
1:50
involved in the trade so it is the
1:51
foundation of everything you're doing
1:53
you don't need to learn anything else
1:55
another thing that liquidity can help
1:56
you with is when the markets are going
1:58
to be choppy and when they're going to
1:59
move move rapidly now a lot of people
2:01
will call this low probability versus
2:03
high probability we both know whenever
2:04
you get into some trades they aren't
2:06
really ideal they take forever to hit
2:08
and a lot of those trades end up getting
2:09
stopped out and a lot of your best
2:11
trades are going to be the ones that you
2:13
pretty much push a button and they may
2:15
not run right to the takeprofit of
2:16
course that's we love that but you kind
2:19
of know when you take a good trade
2:21
versus when you take a bad trade and the
2:22
reason I know that you've been through
2:24
it is because I have been through it too
2:25
in the last 8 years I went from blowing
2:27
all my accounts unprofitable just being
2:30
a complete degenerate never thought I
2:31
would make it in trading but I never
2:32
gave up in fast forward a couple years
2:34
and I've been able to make millions of
2:35
dollars from the markets sometimes even
2:36
over 100,000 a month I've retired my
2:38
parents travel the world do all sorts of
2:40
cool stuff but I would have never done
2:41
that had I not been able to simplify my
2:43
trading strategy which is what I want to
2:44
help you guys do today by eliminating
2:46
all the noise because as you can see
2:48
liquidity literally tells you everything
2:50
you need and it can replace every other
2:52
concept and simplify your approach and
2:54
if there is one thing that I can make an
2:57
impact on you guys who watch this
2:59
channel it's just to simplify everything
3:01
that you're doing in trading because in
3:02
all reality once you get this down it's
3:04
actually not that difficult but in order
3:06
for this to work you have to focus on
3:08
what actually matters you have to
3:09
eliminate all that noise and you just
3:10
need to focus on what gives you your
3:12
entry what gives you your bias what
3:14
gives you your Target and stop- loss and
3:15
liquidity can give you every single one
3:18
of these items so the first topic we're
Daily Bias
3:19
going to talk about is one of the most
3:21
struggled with among ICT Traders and
3:24
that is daily bias so for those of you
3:26
who don't know daily bias is just saying
3:28
are you bullish or bearish on The Daily
3:30
candle essentially what it comes down to
3:32
are you long biased or short biased what
3:34
are you hunting for when you get to your
3:35
screen and liquidity alone can give you
3:38
this in a way simpler way than trying to
3:40
combine 20 different concepts together
3:42
to find your reasoning so when we talk
3:43
about daily bias we have to first
3:45
understand that price is always and I
3:48
mean always moving to one of three
3:50
things it's either moving to a high a
3:52
low or a fair value Gap now for those of
3:54
you who don't know what a fair value Gap
3:55
is it is just when we have these three
3:57
candles with one of them in the middle
3:58
is very expansive there's a gap between
4:01
these two Wicks that's all a fair value
4:02
Gap is and a high and a low in my
4:05
definition is just any candle that has a
4:08
lower high on either side if we're
4:10
talking about a high and if we're
4:11
talking about a low it's going to be any
4:13
candle that has a low on either side now
4:15
you can't see but this ended up being a
4:16
low this was also a low so it's not
4:19
really like swing structure or like the
4:21
big highs strong highs it's none of that
4:22
it's just any high or low now the higher
4:25
time frames are where you're going to
4:27
spot this liquidity and I'm going to
4:28
give you a set of time time frames that
4:30
you need to use in order to trade
4:32
consistently we always want to start
4:33
from the top down on the higher time
4:35
frames now higher time frame is
4:37
subjective to your set of time frame
4:39
alignment and again I'm going to give
4:40
you guys a nice chart on how to do that
4:43
in a second the lower time frames are
4:45
going to tell you which liquidity price
4:47
is moving towards you're able to
4:48
identify what liquidity has been traded
4:50
into what liquidity lies on the chart
4:53
and then we're going to zoom in so we
4:54
can get a more dissected look at where
4:58
price is going and confirm bias with a
5:00
lot of conviction we're going to use
5:01
liquidity on every time frame to do this
IRL
5:03
now you have probably heard of a lot of
5:04
different concepts but in reality you
5:06
only need two types of liquidity and
5:08
those two types of liquidity uh well
5:10
number one is going to be IRL okay so
5:14
IRL and this just means fair value Gap
5:16
now the reason it's IRL it's just
5:18
internal range liquidity so if we have a
5:20
range between this high and this low
5:23
that is a range so any liquidity inside
5:26
of the range is just internal to the
5:28
range so that would be our Fair Val
5:29
value Gap right here now for the
5:32
external range liquidity that's going to
5:34
be the liquidity at the external of the
5:36
range so IRL is fair value gaps erl it's
5:40
a beautiful e isn't it is just highs or
5:43
lows okay that's all it is highs or lows
5:46
can be either one so in this example we
5:48
have external internal external so we
5:51
always want to look what way the
5:52
Market's reaching towards and what
5:54
liquidity has it recently taken right
5:56
like what liquidity has been traded into
5:58
what did price hit recently so if you
5:59
look look at this example price hit some
6:01
external liquidity over here so we're
6:03
always going to expect the market to go
6:05
from external to internal and back and
6:08
forth okay so it's always going to be in
6:10
this cycle because remember the market
6:11
is always moving to either a fair value
6:14
Gap a high or a low it's always one of
6:16
those that's going to be your draw on
6:17
liquidity now when we're looking at this
6:19
setup we know that we traded into this
6:21
low so we're likely to trade back into
6:24
the fair value Gap now of course we're
6:25
going to have more ways to confirm this
6:27
because not every time you trade into a
6:29
high or low you'll get a retracement but
6:31
this is a good start and a foundation
6:33
for your understanding we're going to
6:34
get into how to dissect this just in a
6:36
second so here's that same example of
6:38
price after we went down and traded back
6:41
into that external cuz remember we come
6:43
back into the internal liquidity and in
6:45
this area we're looking for confirmation
6:48
that we're going to trade back down to
6:49
this external liquidity now if you
6:51
notice we had to dig into it the market
6:53
Consolidated and then finally we got you
6:54
know a reversal up here the best cells
6:56
were in here but if you understood that
6:59
we were bearish at this point you could
7:01
have been looking to sell all through
7:02
this down move because remember this is
7:04
your higher time frame you don't really
7:05
need to catch that much of this move to
7:07
make a lot of money I mean in fact even
7:08
if you just caught a portion of this
7:10
wick on a lower time frame you can get
7:11
really good risk reward so how do we
7:13
confirm you know we're not selling in
7:15
this area and we're going to get stopped
7:17
out and H how do we confirm when the
7:18
retracement is over because that's
7:20
really what it is when we move to
7:21
internal liquidity it's just a
7:23
retracement right how do we confirm when
7:24
that's over and we're going to go to
7:26
external liquidity and we're going to
7:28
expand now and these moves where we're
7:30
retracing those are usually going to be
7:32
choppier and then expanding away from
7:34
fair value gaps usually are going to be
7:36
the more expansive moves something that
Time Frames
7:38
I cannot stress enough is that time
7:40
frame selection when you're doing this
7:43
is everything if you don't use the right
7:45
time frames you won't get this right
7:48
what I'm about to explain is how we're
7:49
going to confirm the bias with a lower
7:51
time frame framework so we're going to
7:52
hop right in see how we confirm it and
7:54
then I'm going to give you a list of
7:55
time frames that you're going to use so
7:57
always remember that the lower time
7:59
tells you which liquidity that price is
8:01
moving towards so if we have this
8:02
example we know because we've seen the
8:04
example now that we come back up into
8:06
this move and move down but it's not a
8:08
value to us to just have a bias or just
8:10
have an idea you see a lot of people
8:13
mistake the fact that oh we just traded
8:15
into this fair value Gap we're must be
8:16
going lower you know oh it's internal
8:18
range to external and while that is true
8:20
the liquidity alone is just an idea you
8:23
never have a high probability setup from
8:25
one thing and that's something else
8:27
that's very important that I want to
8:28
throw in here and anytime you're framing
8:30
a trade if you're just using one idea or
8:33
one time frame it's likely going to be a
8:36
low probability trade okay the more
8:38
confluences or the more signatures on
8:40
the chart telling you the same thing
8:42
that you can stack together the higher
8:43
the quality of the trade just that goes
8:45
for anything whether you're trading ICT
8:47
or not because it's just more checks
8:49
that you're you're adding it's almost
8:50
like if you're grading a trade you have
8:52
more good things to say about it the
8:54
more confluences you have so we want to
8:55
make sure that our higher time frames
8:57
and this is a very important um concept
9:00
to kind of grasp you want to make sure
9:02
that your higher time frames equal your
9:04
lower time frames and what I mean by
9:05
that is not necessarily that they're
9:07
always both bearish or both bullish it
9:10
just means that they're in synchronicity
9:11
so let's just say if you're expecting
9:14
you know a move from this area down here
9:17
like you're expecting us to go back into
9:19
that fair value Gap well if the lower
9:20
time frame is telling you that and the
9:22
higher time frame is telling you that by
9:24
you know we've traded into external
9:25
range liquidity so we know we're likely
9:27
to go back up you could have a bullish
9:28
lower time frame in a bearish higher
9:30
time frame and still have alignment it's
9:32
a very important concept to grasp it
9:34
just has to be clear on both time frames
9:36
now the way that we're going to
9:37
visualize these retracements and
9:38
expansions is going to be using Market
9:41
maker models now this is a term I think
9:43
a lot of people get intimidated by
9:44
because it's far over complicated in
9:46
this industry but I'm going to explain
9:48
this in a very easy way it's going to
9:50
change the way you look at the markets
9:51
forever all right so this is the time
9:52
frame alignment that I was talking about
9:54
if you're looking at the IRL to erl move
9:57
on one of these time frames then one of
9:59
these time frames is where you would
10:00
look to confirm the retracement or
10:02
expansion using a lower time frame
10:04
Market maker model so you can take a
10:05
screenshot of this I'm going to go to
10:06
the next slide and take a look at some
10:08
of these Market maker models now here is
10:09
a fair value Gap or IRL right so we've
10:13
got IRL on the higher time frame so
10:15
we're expecting the market to move down
10:17
lower so the way that we're going to do
10:19
this is on the way up into our IRL or to
10:23
our erl what we want to see is at least
10:25
two or more consolidations two or more
10:27
consolidations now you notice that we
10:29
have three the key is once we get close
10:32
to or in the key level you always want
10:34
to see one last stop hunt you always
10:36
want to see the market fake out so to
10:38
speak so until you see that don't pay
10:39
attention to any Market structure moving
10:41
down I mean I wouldn't consider that a
10:42
market structure shift but even if there
10:44
was you know fair value gaps to the
10:45
downside I still wouldn't want to trade
10:47
that no no matter if it inverts fa value
10:49
gaps or gives you any of these entry
10:50
patterns because you haven't had that
10:52
stop hunt and again liquidity tells you
10:53
everything so until you've swept
10:54
liquidity you don't want to just start
10:56
pushing the button so as soon as we've
10:58
done all that and then you start to get
11:00
these Market structure shifts and create
11:02
fair value gaps to the downside like you
11:04
have right there as soon as that happens
11:06
now on every on the right side of this
11:08
area you just cross the line in the sand
11:10
and now everything is bearish and you're
11:12
looking for sells anytime we trade into
11:14
a bearish fairv value Gap or anytime we
11:16
trade above a high bonus if you get both
11:18
of those things so once you're on the
11:20
right side of the curve then you know
11:22
that we're likely to expand towards this
11:24
erl now if you looked at the higher time
11:27
frame what this would look like is just
11:29
simply boom we hit down fair value Gap
11:32
and then there's a low when you look at
11:33
this on a lower time frame you get a
11:35
much more in-depth View and a whole new
11:37
world of opportunity opens do you want
Internal vs External Liquidity
11:39
to know the biggest realization that
11:41
completely changed my perspective on ICT
11:43
well that was internal range liquidity
11:45
to external range liquidity but with one
11:49
key thing that we've added which is
11:50
Market maker models you'll find that all
11:53
of these things that you've probably
11:54
tried to you know Master daily bias with
11:56
you know combining every last concept
11:59
you you've learned it all comes into
12:01
Market maker models and internal range
12:03
liquidity or external range liquidity
12:05
that gives you bias gives you everything
12:06
you need and this is all done just by
12:08
using liquidity because the way that
12:09
we're confirming Market maker models is
12:11
when we have a fair value Gap after
12:12
we've swept liquidity in a higher time
12:14
frame fair value gap which is internal
12:16
range liquidity now that we've talked
12:17
about finding daily bias and confirming
12:19
it how do we actually execute and this
12:21
is where a lot of people get stuck
12:23
because they they may have the higher
12:25
time frame bias they may have a good
12:26
framework when it comes time to trade
12:29
start slipping up and making mistakes
12:30
now now this is probably a lot of you
12:31
and that's okay because it's totally
12:33
normal this is probably the hardest part
Time to Trade
12:35
of trading right is is actually going
12:36
out and executing but I'm going to give
12:38
you a simple strategy that you can use
12:39
it's going to open up a whole new world
12:41
of opportunity and stop you from just
12:42
having to sit on your hands in fear
12:44
hesitating so once a market maker model
12:46
is identified any liquidity can be used
12:48
to frame a trade now that can go from
12:51
IRL or erl okay so either one anytime we
12:55
trade into one of these on our Market
12:57
maker time frame you have a trade setup
12:59
that you can take you're just going to
13:01
use the lower time frame to confirm it
13:02
now the key here is that this must and I
13:04
mean must occur during the session don't
13:06
just look for any Market maker model or
13:09
any tap into liquidity the goal here is
Where to Trade
13:11
not to just become a pattern Trader but
13:13
to trade in context and make sure that
13:15
we're trading with a high probability so
13:16
for me I like trading between 9:30 a.m.
13:18
and around 10:30 a.m. sometimes I'll go
13:20
to 11: but usually it falls within that
13:22
first hour of the day that's where I
13:24
find my best setups are and I have data
13:25
showing that is where I perform the best
13:27
and I encourage you guys to figure out
13:28
where you perform the best whether it's
13:29
London session whatever it is you need
13:31
to understand this because if you just
13:33
look for this at all times it's not
13:35
going to work out for you now there's a
13:36
bonus and again we talked about
13:37
Confluence earlier bonus if both IRL and
13:40
erl used so for example let's just say
13:43
you have your Market maker model and
13:45
you're already on the downside you
13:47
started to shift down let's just say we
13:49
have a fair value Gap here and you're
13:50
waiting this is your you know your
13:52
Market maker time frame we sweep
13:54
liquidity into a fair value Gap now in
13:57
this area that's where you're going to
13:58
have the high high probability sells
14:00
because the Market's taken liquidity
14:02
it's also traded into a fair value Gap
14:04
because at this time once you've you
14:05
know moved to the right side of the
14:07
curve like we talked about earlier
14:09
everything on the right side you're just
14:10
looking for an area to get in because
14:12
you've already identified which way the
14:14
market is drawing towards or the drawn
14:16
liquidity and you're just using price at
Execution Alignment
14:19
that point as stepping stones to get
14:21
there so let's talk about execution
14:23
alignment now if you have found your
14:25
Market maker model on this time frame
14:28
You' go to this as your entry now you
14:29
notice this is the same exact alignment
14:31
as the IRL to erl and then Market maker
14:33
model so if you use a combination of
14:35
three time frames so for example like if
14:37
you went weekly to the 4 Hour okay
14:39
where's the 4 Hour at then You' go from
14:40
the 4 Hour to the 15 minute okay so like
14:43
this would be you know your IRL erl
14:46
Market maker model and then execution
14:49
you could do this combination with any
14:50
of these personally what I do is the 4H
14:53
hour to the 15 minute and then the 15
14:56
minute to the 1 minute this is what a
14:58
lot of you you guys are going to be
14:59
doing if you're day trading but I
15:00
usually will do my IRL to Earl in the 4
15:02
Hour look for a 15-minute Market maker
15:04
model and use that liquidity plus my one
15:07
minute for an entry model so let's break
Trade Example
15:09
down this trade example now we're going
15:11
to look at the price first but this is a
15:13
trade that I actually took and I'm going
15:14
to break it down step by step that way
15:16
you guys can learn from a real example
15:17
not just some cherry-picked hindsight
15:19
that a lot of gurus will do but we look
15:21
at this the market came into a higher
15:23
time frame fair value Gap okay we came
15:25
in and as soon as we start to push out
15:27
of here with displacement soon as we get
15:29
that that fair value Gap right there
15:31
that is when we identify that the market
15:33
is moving to the upside now you could
15:35
have also looked at it as this inverted
15:37
fair value Gap anytime that we start to
15:38
have bullish scenarios in context when
15:41
we've swept liquidity and we have those
15:44
two or more
15:46
consolidations before we trade down into
15:49
the liquidity anytime that happens
15:51
you've got a clear Market maker model so
15:52
anything to the right of here we'd look
15:54
at as bullish and if you notice how does
15:56
the market react to fair value gaps or
15:58
lows now it's not perfect we we lost on
16:00
a fair value Gap there but if you look
16:01
every time the market comes under a low
16:03
then creates fair value gaps usually
16:05
it's going to move to the upside even
16:06
with these small fair value gaps up here
16:07
because the market is drawing up to that
16:11
erl on the higher time frame now what
16:14
this looked like on the higher time
16:15
frame was just something as simple as
16:16
this moving from a fair value Gap to the
16:19
erl and this erl is this right here and
16:21
we've traded down and this leg in price
16:24
is what we're visualizing with the
16:25
market maker model so we look right here
16:27
any of these times we trade into a fair
16:29
value Gap or under a low that is where
16:31
you could hunt for a trade setup now
16:33
this is where I hunted for one and we'll
16:34
take a look at that trade right now so
16:36
right here you can see the executions
16:38
originally originally I was trying to
16:40
take a scalp sell a little longer so you
16:42
see this Arrow right here but I ended up
16:44
selling that and then taking along I did
16:47
this live in front of a couple hundred
16:48
people too but this is where I made 4500
16:51
from this trade you can see it's the
16:52
same exact example and the reason that I
16:54
took it is we look at the overall setup
16:57
here we had that fair value Gap from the
16:59
market maker time frame so let's go back
17:01
to this example so you can see the
17:02
higher time frame which is the market
17:03
maker model we had that fair value Gap
17:05
right here so anytime we trade into any
17:07
liquidity on that market maker time
17:09
frame all we're looking for down here is
17:11
our entry okay an entry model say em and
17:15
we're going up towards this so we've
17:16
identified what way price is drawing
17:18
towards so we've identified what way the
17:20
river is Flowing we're just looking for
17:21
a pit stop to get in so as soon as we
17:23
get into that market maker time frame
17:26
all we're looking for is either an
17:27
inverted fair value Gap where you know
17:29
we have a fair value Gap to the downside
17:30
and then we push out and close through
17:32
that fair value Gap that's all you
17:33
really need in order to enter a trade
17:35
now what I did here was I actually
17:37
waited for a new fair value Gap to form
17:38
which is a little bit of a hesitation
17:40
but I still executed and we were able to
17:42
get really good risk to reward all the
17:44
way up to that external Range High now
17:46
if you go back and look you'll see that
17:47
I scaled out once right here and then
17:49
scaled out the rest and caught almost
17:51
400 points on NASDAQ which is pretty
17:53
cool it's a good trade on NASDAQ for any
17:54
of those who of those of you who know
17:56
and trade NASDAQ you know that that's a
17:58
pretty good move and you could see that
17:59
I made this not risking a lot okay made
18:02
4500 bucks trading micros just because
18:04
it was a huge move now let's talk about
18:06
another way that you can execute which
18:08
is without using the lower time frames
18:10
just using the market maker time frame
18:12
okay you may just directly trade using
18:14
that you don't have to drop down to the
18:15
lower time frame so if we look at this
18:17
example you could have just taken a
18:18
trade right here put a stop loss under
18:20
that and targeted this and got good risk
18:22
to reward that's a fine trade and it
18:24
takes a lot of the stress off as well
18:26
and there's numerous entries like this
18:27
like you could look anytime we come
18:28
under a low if we start to create fair
18:30
value gaps to the upside that's an entry
18:32
anytime that we get a market structure
18:33
shift that's an entry just anything on
18:35
the right side of this it's free game
18:37
because you've identified what you're
18:38
drawing towards now the timing of the
18:39
entry is key you want this to always
18:41
occur during the session and again
18:43
during the first couple hours of that
18:45
session even if you're using a 15minute
18:46
or whatever now if you're swing trading
18:48
using like a 4 hour that's completely
18:50
different bonus though if IRL and erl
18:52
used again so if you sweep liquidity and
18:54
go into a fair value Gap you don't even
18:55
really need a confirmation at that point
18:57
if you've identified which way the r is
18:59
Flowing you can just execute so like
19:00
let's say if you had your Market maker
19:02
model and you were coming up to the
19:04
upside and you swept a low into a fair
19:06
value Gap and you identified already
19:08
that you know you you moving to the
19:10
upside you could have just entered as
19:12
soon as you got on this fair value Gap
19:14
put a stop loss below it and you'll get
19:15
better risk reward that way because
19:16
you've gotten two confluences so here's
19:18
an example of that this is just the
19:20
higher time frame where we found the
19:21
liquidity this is the market maker model
19:23
time frame so if we look the market
19:25
maker model was confirmed as soon as we
19:27
started to invert these fair value gaps
19:29
you can wait for new fair value gaps to
19:30
be created for even more confirmation as
19:33
soon as that happened what you can do if
19:35
you notice right here you can there's
19:36
tons of entries so look we swept this
19:38
liquidity and went into a fair value Gap
19:40
right there that was an entry could have
19:41
just put a trade there stop above this
19:43
and just trade it all the way down
19:44
anytime we sweep liquidity and then
19:46
create a fair value Gap to the downside
19:48
that is an entry you can just use this
19:50
time frame to enter the trade you'll
19:52
notice right here we swept liquidity
19:53
traded into a fair value Gap that is an
19:55
entry and you're just going to put stops
19:57
at the nearest swing High there's tons
19:58
of entries in every single Market maker
20:00
model you just have to know how to hunt
20:01
for them and where to place your stop
20:02
loss here's another example we came into
20:04
a 15-minute and this is a 1 minute
20:05
Market maker model so we had an
20:07
inversion right here that's where it's
20:08
converted now many of you may be
20:10
familiar with Breakers um if not this is
20:13
just an old example but you don't even
20:14
need the breakers that's an entry as
20:16
soon as you created this inversion
20:18
that's an entry right there stops the
20:20
low and then anytime you sweep under
20:22
lows or trade into any kind of fair
20:24
value gaps that is an entry now in this
20:26
all we really did was sweep under lows
20:28
didn't give it ton of entries cuz you're
20:29
in that lower time frame that's going to
20:31
give you a quicker move look I've been
Conclusion
20:32
at this for years and I can tell you
20:34
right now this video is literally
20:36
everything you need so just studyed a
20:38
couple times feel free to ask me
20:39
questions in the comments but if you can
20:40
Master this then you have mastered ICT
20:42
because this is what really matters and
20:44
anybody who's been trading ICT for a
20:46
while go ahead and comment because I
20:48
guarantee most of you guys will agree
20:49
with me I know there's a lot of people
20:50
that are still in the rabbit hole of
20:52
trying to learn all the complex stuff
20:54
and all the conspiracy type things you
20:55
have to understand none of that really
20:57
matters or is going to make make you
20:58
money so what I like to do is just
20:59
simplify things into something that's
21:01
actually able to implement to make money
21:04
from I also want to remind you guys to
21:05
never give up on trading as as hard as
21:07
it may seem as complex and overwhelming
21:09
as it may seem if you stick with this
21:10
you will get it it just may take you
21:12
years especially if you're doing it on
21:14
your own which is fine that's how I did
21:15
it you could learn everything that you
21:16
need for free here on YouTube it's just
21:18
going to take you a lot longer but if
21:19
