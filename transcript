'm about to teach you everything that there is to know about ICT So if you've been stuck in this rabbit hole bouncing
0:06
from video to video and overthinking everything wondering why it seems like everybody besides you is winning trading
0:12
ICT then today we solve that forever And to be clear if you feel stuck you are
0:17
not alone Because just a couple of years ago I was door dashing delivering burgers to fund $100 into my trading
0:24
account But fast forward a couple years and I've made millions of dollars I've gotten funded with multiple prop firms
0:29
I've had multiple six-figure months And in just the last couple of weeks I made $46,000 trading ICT concepts But it
0:36
didn't start like that because for years I was in the exact same place that you're in right now I was emotional I
0:41
was overtrading confused and I felt like it was never going to work So with my younger self in mind I took everything
0:48
that I've learned over the last nine years all the mistakes all the breakthroughs the wins and the losses
0:53
and I condensed it into what I'm going to share with you today Now yes this is a full free course but I want you to
0:59
take this seriously like you paid for it Because truth be told I'm going to teach you more than you'll learn in most paid
1:05
courses And a lot of people ask me why do I give all this out for free And the goal is simple because I want to make
1:10
thousands of profitable traders So pay close attention take notes and let's get started All right guys Before we get
1:16
started I want to pull back the curtain on my broker statement for transparency As you can see my name right here and I
1:22
made $46,000 in just the last couple of weeks trading And here are some of the trades I've taken using the exact
1:27
knowledge that I'm going to teach you guys today Here's one where I made $17,000 Here's another where I made
1:33
$6,500 in one single trade And then here's another one where I made $6,000 And today I'm going to teach you
1:39
everything that I've learned in the last nine years that helped me take those trades and make all the money that I've made from trading And I'm going to be
1:46
giving away $1,000 to three of you today But you have to pay close attention for instructions on how to enter this
1:52
giveaway Now today we're going to go over everything from how to get started trading ICT to core knowledge all the
1:58
way to building a profitable trading system how to trade prop firms and how to set yourself up for long-term success
2:04
And as you can see we've got a lot to cover So let's get started Now before we fully dive in I want you guys to
2:10
download the free study guide by clicking the link in the description I made this video to make as many
2:16
profitable traders as possible So please take this serious So if you want this to actually work download the guide and
2:22
follow along All right so a lot of you guys already know this but for those who don't let's go over what ICT is So the
2:27
idea with ICT is we're always looking for liquidity because this is where the
2:33
smart money trades Now when I say smart money I mean the large market participants the banks the whales the
2:39
hedge funds because we all know the markets are manipulated and we all know that most traders lose money because
2:44
they get manipulated out of their positions You see it with the news telling you that the market's crashing and that's the best time to buy or vice
2:51
versa Whenever the markets are bullish in the news that's the time you want to sell So why is this Well let's just take
2:57
a look at this price example Now what do you see here You see a range and there's probably people who think that we're
3:04
going to be bearish and there's probably some people who think we're going to be bullish Now all the people that want to
3:09
be bearish they're going to put their stop loss up here at this level So no matter if they got short here or
3:15
wherever there's going to be a lot of people who say "If we go above this range then I'm going to get out of my
3:20
trade." And there's also going to be a lot of people who look to buy above that level because they look at it like a
3:26
breakout So what this would be is called buyside liquidity Okay Now liquidity is
3:32
just an area where there's a lot of people willing to exchange the asset whatever it may be So if we see the
3:38
market rush up into one of these levels then we know there's a lot of buying going on there Whether it's people
3:43
getting stopped out on their shorts so that's a buy Like if you're in a sell and you get stopped out that's the
3:49
equivalent to a buy because you sold to enter You have to buy to exit Or people are looking to get into a long at this
3:56
level Now they're buying and they're buying the breakout Now whenever we go into these areas these are prime zones
4:04
where smart money is going to interact Now this is going to shift you guys to think like a true market maker or like
4:10
you are the smart money because that's the only way that you're going to survive in these markets Now if you look at it like this let's just say you had
4:16
$10 million you needed to enter a position with Now you have to have enough people that are going to be
4:22
buying Like let's say if you wanted to take a $10 million sale well you have to wait until there's enough buyers to
4:28
satisfy that order So where are there going to be a lot of buyers At liquidity pools right Where a lot of people are
4:33
getting manipulated in the market So if you're a whale you're going to look to sell at these liquidity zones And in
4:39
this example we can see that that is exactly what happened So ICT is all
4:45
about being able to track this market manipulation so you can trade with it rather than getting manipulated and
4:50
losing money because of it So the idea is that we follow the path that smart money leaves behind through price action
4:57
with no indicators in order to trade profitably Now you've seen tons of people trade this and a lot of people
5:04
are successful and you may have been struggling with this and the reason is because online this is the most
5:10
complicated stuff and a lot of people make it way harder than it has to be But today we're going to solve all of that
5:15
for good because I'm going to show you the simplest way to trade ICT effectively Now in this example let's
5:20
say Smart Money sold a lot of positions up here Well then where are they likely to go take the market next They're going
5:27
to take it to the next area of liquidity So if you look at this chart where would you see a lot of stop- losses being
5:33
placed Well if you said right here you're correct because there's a lot of lows So anywhere there's a lot of lows
5:40
or a lot of highs there's going to be a lot of liquidity and that's going to act as a magnet for price Now I want to be
5:46
clear that price won't always reverse from every pool of liquidity And I'm going to show you guys how to know when
5:51
the market's reversing or when it's going to continue Now in this example
5:57
you can pay attention closely to how we react to highs and lows And this can always tell you where the market's
6:03
likely to go because if we are manipulating highs and if we're displacing through lows that tells us
6:09
that the market's likely bearish Because if we come above a high you got to think of every time we come above a high that
6:14
is an opportunity for Smart Money to sell And if we come below a low that's an opportunity for Smart Money to buy
6:21
But in this example we see that smart money isn't buying but they are selling And as long as you see this continue you
6:27
would then look for the market to trade to lows Now what's happening at these lows is there is a lot of traders who
6:34
are going to either have their stop losses or breakout orders to sell So this is what you would call sellside
6:40
liquidity because anyone who is long in this whole range is likely now going to be stopped out And there's going to be a
6:46
lot of traders who look to sell under this area So anywhere you see a lot of liquidity is a honeypot for smart money
6:53
to take place And we're going to go over numerous ways to read the market through the lens of smart money That way you can
7:00
stop getting manipulated and start profiting from market manipulation Now really quick for those of you guys who
7:05
are brand new let's talk about candlesticks and the way that they work Now if we have a bullish candle the
7:10
lowest part of the body so the body is the square part that is where price opened Now what this shows us is that
7:16
price traveled all the way up to the top of this wick but it didn't close at the
7:21
very high It closed right here So that's the close And then you have the high and the low Now this example is from a 1
7:29
hour chart but you can use literally any time frame to visualize price action And
7:34
all we're doing is visualizing that time range is price action What was the highest high What was the low Where did
7:40
it open Where did it close Now this is very important because whenever you're bearish you're going to expect the open
7:46
and then the high to be made Because if the market's being manipulated what are we going to see We're going to see the
7:52
market jab up before moving down and then you're going to come up for the close So whenever you're bearish you
7:58
need to understand that whatever time frame you're looking at is likely going to go up first make the high and then
8:04
push down to make the low and the close This is going to be important for the time and price module later that I'm
8:12
going to teach you today Now also something that is very important for today's teachings is understanding of a
8:17
swing high the way that I teach it Now a lot of people will have complicated ways of doing this They'll have a bunch of
8:23
different highs and they'll say that you know this is the the swing high and this is the low I don't look at it like that
8:29
The best way to do it is every single candle that has a lower high on either side So see right here right here this
8:37
middle candle has a lower high on either side That makes it a swing high Now for swing lows it's vice versa This candle
8:43
has a higher low on each side So that makes it a swing low It does not have to
8:49
make new structure or any of these other complicated ways in order for you to use swing lows and swing highs for the way
8:55
that I teach price action Now I want to go back to this example and show you something that I like to call trapped
9:01
traders Okay guys trap traders is going to be a very very important idea in ICT
9:07
concepts So if you look right here in this example we understand that the smart money is selling But every time
9:13
the smart money is selling there has to be buyers So you have to look at it like a lot of people are going long right here Now what's going to happen is
9:21
whenever the market moves against them they're going to have their stop losses at different places because there's a lot of traders who trade the breakout of
9:27
every high Some of you guys watching are probably those traders but after today we're going to fix that for good But these traders they're going to have
9:32
their stops here They're going to have them here at this low They're going to have them at this low They're gonna have them all over the place And you have to
9:37
understand that when traders are getting stopped out of a long right Like if all these traders are in longs If they're
9:42
getting stopped out and everybody gets stopped out that is so much selling pressure which then causes these
9:48
aggressive moves like you see here So understanding where traders are trapped in the market can tell you where the
9:54
market's likely to go and where it's not likely to return Because if people were buying above this high you're very
10:00
likely to see price not return there Because if we're smart money we don't want to see traders get out here for a
10:06
profit They are fuel to move price to the downside So as we've said liquidity is just the ease at which an asset is
10:12
bought or sold So if we have a range we know there's going to be a lot of buying at the top of it and there's going to be a lot of selling Now whether this is
10:18
from people getting stopped out on shorts or people trying to buy the breakout or whether it's people getting
10:24
stopped out on longs or people trying to sell this breakdown Now you have to understand that price is always going to
10:30
be moving from liquidity pool to the next because price moves to fill orders It's not because of some random pattern
10:36
like a bull flag or anything you've learned You have to understand that the largest amounts of liquidity build at key levels and this is how we're going
10:42
to find our support and resistance This is how we're going to find where we are going to do business in the market Now I
10:48
want you guys to remember this because this is so powerful and if you ask yourself what the market's doing at
10:53
every turn with this in mind you're going to be a much better trader So in a bullish market you buy from sellers
10:59
under lows at sellside liquidity So for example if you are looking for the market to be bullish if you come under
11:05
lows you're expecting the market to go higher So you want to be positioned
11:10
under those lows and be buying from all the people who are selling Now in a bearish market you sell to buyers above
11:17
highs at buyside liquidity So for example once the market comes above highs in a bearish market you want to
11:24
see it reverse and you want to be selling with the smart money This is exactly how the largest market
11:31
participants operate So you should too And if you watch price action and ask yourself how is price behaving Are we
11:37
manipulating highs or are we manipulating lows You'll be able to have a very clear read on the markets All
11:43
right so now that we've got some of the basics out of the way let's get into the core concepts of ICT We're going to
11:49
start with market structure Now market structure is simply highs and lows Now
11:54
the key is knowing which highs and lows to use and having a practical repeatable
11:59
method of finding market structure Now the reason market structure is important is because it is the foundation of
12:05
everything else you do and it's going to be involved in almost every concept that you learn Yet most people do it
12:11
completely wrong or have complicated ways of doing it that cause them to be paralyzed when it comes time to trade
12:17
Now you've probably seen diagrams like this right Like it wouldn't it be easy if the market just moved like this Now
12:22
of course yes we understand that market structure is higher highs and higher lows but we all know it's not that easy
12:28
Or maybe it is Now after years of struggling with market structure and losing trades because I didn't know what
12:34
I was doing I realized that the only market structure that was valid was whenever it was accompanied by
12:40
displacement Now if you guys have been watching my channel for any period of time you've probably heard me say this word a million times but displacement is
12:47
just energetic moves So the idea here is that we're trading with smart money So if we're trading with smart money you
12:52
want to have energetic big pushes So for example does it look like smart money bought right here No It looks like smart
12:59
money sold in this wick Now I want you guys to understand that smart money a lot of times is getting active in the
13:05
wick of candles because it takes a lot of selling pressure to create a wick this large So if you see something like
13:10
this through a point of structure or through a swing point then that is what we call manipulation and the market is
13:17
likely to reverse But if you see displacement this means that there wasn't any smart money activity selling
13:22
above this high And if smart money is not selling at this high then the market's likely trading up higher So
13:28
whenever it comes to structure just pay attention to what is getting displaced and what is getting manipulated Now
13:33
let's look at a price action example If we look right here the market comes up above these highs Now a lot of people
13:40
will say "Oh well it closed a candle body so it's going to continue." That just doesn't work I'm going to show you
13:45
guys some very mechanical ways of how to determine when to expect manipulation or displacement But for now let's take a
13:51
look at this example So as we can see the market comes up above it but we don't create any kind of fair value gap
13:57
Now a fair value gap is one of the core pillars of ICT All it is is when you
14:02
have an expansive candle like this that leaves a gap between the candle before its wick and the candle after its wick
14:09
So we displaced through that low Now we expect this market to continue and create bearish market structure And what
14:16
does it do It creates a low creates a high and then it goes to the next low Now when you use displacement and
14:22
manipulation what you can do is anytime we displace a low you see that price leg that displaced it Whatever point is made
14:28
by that price leg is likely to get traded into later like you see right here And this will likely continue until
14:35
you manipulate And as you can see right here there's no fair value gap created through this low and we immediately pop
14:41
back above it Now whenever you manipulate what you expect is the swing point that failed to displace through
14:47
this low which would be whatever swing high was made which is right there We expect that to be traded into Now if you
14:55
look over here this low failed to displace this high so it was traded back
15:00
into Now when you combine manipulation and displacement you have even higher probability that the market's likely to
15:06
continue And just by looking at this price action you can see we displace here What happens The market continues
15:12
through this high We manipulate these lows What happens We displace through this high Now if you look right here we
15:18
push up and displace through that high So just that next high is the target But
15:23
right there we failed to make a fair value gap So we then retrace down to the low that failed to push through the high
15:30
Now this is just one example but I want you guys to test on your charts how often this works because this is
15:36
something that changed the way that I looked at the markets forever and it finally gave me clarity to market structure without trying to map out you
15:43
know all of these big ranges and all these different things Now coming back to this example as you can see right
15:48
here this is the same thing we're talking about We fail to displace We don't create a fair value gap And then
15:53
what happens We displace through this low creating these fair value gaps And then what happens the market continues
15:59
down lower We fail to displace through this high and then the market displaces lower And you will see that this is a
16:05
pattern the market repeats over and over and over again Next let's talk about premium and discount Now before we get
16:12
into it I want you to think of trading like a business and candles are your product Let's just say you have candles
16:18
for sale meaning you want to sell you're bearish Do you want to sell your product for a premium or would you want to sell
16:23
it for a discount The answer is obviously anytime you sell something you want to sell it for a premium price You want to sell for high And if you want to
16:29
buy then you would want to buy for a discount So let's take a look through this example The market displaced down
16:35
through this low and it created a fair value gap right here So if we're looking
16:40
for an area of where the market's likely to go back up into before it moves down lower you can use premium and discount
16:47
to tell you where that's likely to happen So if we take this tool right here you're going to go on Trading View You go to fib and you mark it out And
16:54
this is what the settings you want to use You'd want to just have nothing marked except one zero and 0.5 Okay What
17:02
this does is it draws a midpoint It draws a line right down the middle of this range And we look at it like
17:09
anything above the midpoint is premium and anything below is discount So if we
17:14
have displaced through a low we know the market's likely going to continue down lower And when we watch the market we
17:21
want to say okay well if I want to sell this market I want to sell it from a fair value gap in a premium And then you
17:27
can see that the market comes up into this area before it continues down to
17:33
the downside Now whenever you create a new leg in price you want to check did we displace Now in this example you see
17:39
right here we displaced by creating this fair value gap right here So if you took your fib tool you'd want to draw it from
17:45
the new high all the way down to the bottom of the displacement Now you just want to draw it from one swing point
17:52
down to the next And if you look right here we then have another fair value gap in premium And as you can see we have
17:58
another fair value gap up here in premium And we have one right here So in this example we look at the market like
18:04
it's likely to go back up into premium into these fair value gaps Now I'm going to show you how to execute trades
18:10
towards these levels away from these levels how to know which fair value gap to choose and much more But for now I
18:16
want you to understand the idea of premium and discount whenever we're talking about market structure So when
18:22
you look for reversals you're looking for them to likely happen in premium or in discount depending on if you're
18:28
bullish or bearish on the previous price like now On a higher time frame you're usually going to get a very straight
18:34
move like we just showed with impulses But if you go to a lower time frame there's going to be a lot of different structure in between On the lower time
18:40
frame you can get an earlier read of when this higher time frame leg is going to continue For example let's go on this
18:46
chart and take a look at what price look like in this price leg So as we can see we came up into this premium and the
18:53
market is now in that fair value gap So once you see the lower time frames start to shift and they also start to
19:00
manipulate highs and displace lows that means they're aligned with that higher
19:05
time frame And this is where you look to trade and look for all the other ICT patterns Now there are numerous ways you
19:12
can know exactly where the market's likely to reverse exactly where to trade where to put your stop-loss and not only
19:19
that what time the market's likely to do this Now we're going to tie everything I teach you today into a full strategy of
19:26
how to put all this together But for now I want you guys to focus on these basic concepts Now whenever it comes to which
19:32
time frames you pair together it's very important that you follow time frame alignment So if you look over here to
19:38
the left I have put together a list of what you would use as the higher time frame on the left and then the lower
19:43
time frame on the right That example we just used was a 15-minute chart and a one minute chart to confirm that that
19:50
15minute leg was likely to move to the downside Now whenever it comes to these time frame pairings you're going to use
19:57
this for any higher time frame to lower time frame strategy that you learn today
20:02
Now market structure is great and it tells you where price is likely to move However it does not tell you why or when
20:11
And these two components are very very important to making sure that you trade consistently because knowing where the
20:17
market's going to go doesn't pay you Executing on it is what actually matters Now we talked about earlier with
20:23
liquidity it's just where people are putting their stop losses So every time you look at a chart you need to be
20:28
thinking about that Where are the obvious areas of stop- losses Now some examples of this are going to be highs
20:34
and lows like we talked about but also trend lines chart patterns and psychological levels like round numbers
20:41
For example Bitcoin at 100,000 Everybody wanted to buy Bitcoin above 100K meaning
20:46
there's a lot of liquidity there So the smart money offloaded their positions and dumped on everybody Now when you
20:51
look at this example you can see that there's trend lines And then also if you have equal highs those are very high
20:58
value areas of liquidity because a lot more people are going to be positioned there So anytime there is a smooth edge
21:05
on the chart meaning you can draw a line from a bunch of highs or a bunch of lows then you know that the market is likely
21:11
to trade to that level before continuing on the real move So I want you to take a look at this chart and tell me what you
21:16
see If you've been paying attention this far you'll notice that we have a lot of liquidity built up on both sides of the
21:22
market Now you might think "Oh well we swept liquidity here and we're likely to reverse and go to these equal highs."
21:29
But you're wrong Why is that Well if you look right here did we have any displacement to the upside Now the
21:36
answer is no The only time we interacted with the high we failed to displace So
21:41
the market's likely to continue down lower But we do understand that yes there is a lot of liquidity up at these
21:48
areas So if you were on the lower time frames and you saw signs of a reversal down here you could have taken a trade
21:54
up to this level Now this may seem like a lot right now but as we go through today all of this is going to come
22:00
together and you're going to be trading this like a pro Now whenever you find areas of liquidity whether it's the relatively equal highs or trend lines
22:08
whatever it may be you always want to ask yourself how is price reacting to these levels And that's going to tell you everything you need to know Now
22:14
let's tie in a few of these concepts together so you know which way the market's likely to go when you look at the charts As we see right here we
22:20
manipulated this high and then displaced a low Now what we've created is a range
22:26
here and we have a fair value gap Fair value gap is what we're going to call internal range liquidity So any levels
22:33
that are going to be inside of a range in price between a swing high and a swing low is going to be internal range
22:39
liquidity Now you need to understand that the market is always going to move from internal range liquidity to
22:45
external range liquidity Now external range liquidity is just highs and lows So if we look at this example what does
22:51
the market do Well the market trades into this internal range liquidity and then continues down lower And as you can
22:57
see as the market continuously moves down lower we keep creating more and more fair value gaps which show us the
23:04
market's likely to continue in this direction because we're displacing through lows And then when the market comes into these fair value gaps we
23:10
continue lower Now I want you to really understand this concept because once you get the overall direction the market's
23:17
moving and the way you're going to do that is by just watching how we react to liquidity pools and then watching what
23:23
kind of ranges are formed from that with displacement So for example let's just say we traded into a level right here
23:30
The market then moves away from it and creates internal range liquidity It's showing you that it wants to expand Now
23:36
I'm going to show you guys how to mark what levels we're expanding to later But as soon as you understand that the
23:42
market's moving from one level to the next then you can look for the market to move from internal range liquidity to
23:48
external range liquidity until you hit that target As we can see here the market had hit up into a key level and
23:54
then we create fair value gaps So the market moves from that internal range liquidity back towards external range
24:00
liquidity We create more internal range liquidity and when the market trades into it we go where back to whatever
24:07
external range liquidity was created This is how the market moves over and over again Now I don't know how many of
24:12
you guys traded retail concepts before you found ICT but for those of you who didn't there's a very popular pattern
24:18
called the bull flag What this is is whenever you have a large move up and then you have this flag or penant-like
24:25
formation Now these are very very very high amounts of liquidity because a lot of retail traders look at this and say
24:31
I'm going to wait for the breakout and we hit right here I'm going to buy So think about it Wherever there is a large
24:37
amount of buyers we look for what Well as smart traders we're then going to
24:42
look for manipulation Okay So for example let's say if you see right here
24:48
a lot of people are getting into the market because it's a bull flag right You might even get some kind of fake out
24:54
move but we as smart traders are looking for signs of how you can then capitalize
25:01
on all that liquidity So anytime you see the market creating a bull flag trading into equal highs trading into highs and
25:08
failing to displace and then we displace to the downside what do you look for Well now you have context to say the
25:15
market's likely moving from internal range liquidity which is this fair value gap down lower Now where are we likely
25:21
to move You guessed it the low of the range Because the market moves from one area of liquidity to the next Now I
25:28
can't drill this into your guys' heads enough Now we're just getting started I've barely even scratched the surface but I'm telling you guys if you can
25:34
simply understand manipulation displacement and fair value gaps and understand where liquidity is resting
25:40
already you're going to be twice as good of a trader as you are right now because you're going to be able to avoid bad trades and you're going to be able to
25:46
execute with confidence As we can see the market went down lower Now again we're just scratching the surface but
25:52
this stuff is powerful even though it's basic But I want to be clear that liquidity isn't everything okay It will
25:58
help you be a better trader than you are right now And after you see it you won't be able to unsee it But without a clear
26:04
way to use it and a consistent system it can possibly do more harm than good because then you start looking at
26:09
everything like a reversal And I'm not going to be like most of the ICT gurus and tell you that every single liquidity
26:16
pool is going to give a reversal because we all know that's not the case Now liquidity can tell us where the market's
26:21
likely to eventually move Now if we have a lot of equal lows sure at some point
26:26
the market's likely going to move down into them But how would you have known it's not this move or this move or this
26:33
move Now this is where ICT traders get stuck and 90% of them remain on this hamster wheel never becoming profitable
26:40
because they look at every single time we hit a point of liquidity as a reversal So you have to know exactly
26:45
where to trade Now I like to break down trading into three pillars okay Where do
26:50
you trade Like what levels do you look at What do you look for at those levels
26:56
And when do you trade Because if you have those three things down and it's very clear it's not subjective and you
27:02
have a repeatable clear-cut plan of what to do when you get into the markets your trading will change overnight Because
27:08
all these things that you think are "Oh I have psychological issues I need to go read Trading in the Zone or some
27:13
psychology book." It's dude You don't have psychology issues You just don't have a clear-cut way of doing
27:19
things So whenever it comes time to trade you freeze You paralyze You hesitate You overtrade You do all the
27:25
that keeps you unprofitable So today I'm going to solve all of that by simplifying all this stuff we're teaching into a system that is going to
27:32
make more profitable traders than any other single YouTube video on this planet So this brings us into
27:37
key levels Now this is where we separate precision versus guessing Now I want you guys to understand that every high
27:43
probability trade starts from a key level There are numerous kinds of key levels that we're going to be using and
27:48
without them you're just guessing Now I want to be clear that not all key levels are created equal Okay Some are going to
27:55
be tools that we use for targets Some we're going to use for entries Some we're going to use for stop- losses And
28:01
the way that you use them is extremely important if you want to stay consistent Now we're going to simplify this So don't be overwhelmed because most of the
28:08
time you've already learned too much Like there's already too many key levels that you know of which causes you to
28:13
look everywhere for a trade or you hesitate or overthink We're going to remove 80% of that fluff and show you
28:19
exactly what you need to be looking for So we've already talked about one of the most foundational key levels which is something that most ICT traders think
28:26
they understand but very few actually use correctly Now we already talked about fair value gaps just being a gap
28:31
with this expansive candle but these can be used from everything from a higher time frame level to trade from to how
28:38
you confirm a trade entry to where you put your stop-loss However some fair
28:43
value gaps have a higher probability of continuing than others And yes fair value gaps are central to ICT is one of
28:49
the cornerstones of ICT But blindly using them or anything is a recipe for
28:56
you to suck at trading And a lot of people do this They think "Oh I learned this pattern You know I'm going to trade
29:01
every single fair value gap there is." And then they wonder why they're not profitable Okay understand that these
29:06
levels I teach you literally mean nothing I mean these mean nothing if you don't have context So let's break down
29:13
the different kinds of fair value gaps and how to properly use them to trade profitably Now if we look at this
29:20
example we can obviously see there's a really big fair value gap Okay Now a lot of people see big fair value gaps and
29:25
think "Oh my god it's the best fair value gap ever." And this can be true sometimes Let me explain This fair value
29:31
gap is very high probability Now I want you to take a look at this and think why this fair value gap Now again most of
29:38
you are going to say because it's large However the reason that this fair value gap is high probability is because it is
29:43
what we call a break in structure gap or a BSG Now why are these valuable Well if
29:51
we look this fair value gap broke through a tremendous amount of structure We displaced through not just one low
29:57
but a lot of lows Okay so what this tells us is that this market was just
30:02
rapidly pushing through all these areas where smart money could have had the opportunity to buy Remember we look for
30:08
smart money to buy under lows And if you don't see smart money doing that then guess what The market's likely bearish
30:14
Because if the market was bullish smart money would look at opportunities to buy However it's not looking at anything
30:20
There are no buyers stepping in and aggressive selling is in control Now something else that you have to think
30:27
about is sometimes retail traders get lucky and are on the right side of smart money So remember when we talk about
30:33
lows what is happening at lows Most people in ICT always just think it's sellside liquidity because people are
30:39
getting stopped out on longs And while that is the case we also have to remember people are selling the breakout
30:45
So there's going to be people selling every one of these lows And what that's going to create is a lot of liquidity at
30:52
their entry point So I'm going to delete this box right here so you can see better But think of it like this Like a lot of people sold on the break of this
30:58
low A lot of people sold on the break of this low right here So there's going to have been a lot of people entered the
31:05
market And if the market moves rapidly in their direction what are they going to do What do retail traders do too
31:10
early when the market moves in their direction Well traders who are unprofitable often times move their stops up to their entry Now what has
31:19
this just created This just created a lot of liquidity at these areas So if you are looking at the market saying
31:25
that we have a very high probability of continuing because of a break-in structure gap what these points can tell
31:32
you is where the market's likely going to reverse from in this fair value gap Now these points are called inflection
31:38
points or IP Now I made up that term No ICT has never said it He'll probably see
31:44
this video and say that it's wrong I don't care I've learned over the years that ICT stuff is good But as you'll see
31:51
today I don't use 80% of the complicated stuff I just use stuff that makes sense to me and has helped me over the years
31:57
So as we can see in this example the market will then eventually come back up to these inflection points Okay it's
32:03
very very likely the market's going to come back up to them and you can expect the market to give a reaction from them
32:10
Now I want you guys to understand that the market once it hits into a key level then you look to see what happens next
32:17
So you wouldn't have paid attention to any of this stuff down here because it's just noise Okay Once we hit into key
32:22
levels we're expecting the market to move Then guess what Then the market creates another fair value gap right
32:28
here You could have traded this move down and so forth Now I want you guys to pay attention to something else that you
32:34
may not have seen on the first go around right here What happens from this area right here Boom We hit into that
32:41
inflection point and move lower Now inflection points are great levels that are used later on once price returns to
32:46
old fair value gaps However you don't have to have an inflection point to trade every fair value gap They're just
32:52
useful tools that can give you a more pinpoint level of where inside a fair value gap holds the most liquidity
32:58
Because the whole idea behind fair value gaps is that there was such an aggressive amount of selling here that
33:04
we expanded rapidly and there wasn't enough time to offer the other side of
33:09
the market So the only thing that was going on here was aggressive selling and the market was rushing to the downside
33:15
So when the market moves back up here especially to inflection points you can look for signs of a reversal Now if you
33:22
see the market hitting into these levels and you go on the lower time frames right here what you're likely going to see is that manipulation and
33:29
displacement This pattern is going to be something you see all over the place But the key here is you have to look at it
33:35
at the right areas okay Not just anywhere If you just try to do this by itself it's not going to work very well
33:40
But as you notice right here we hit into this and then what We displace through lows and then you see the market continue down I'm telling you guys once
33:47
you see this you won't unsee it and your trading changes forever Now let's talk about the next kind of fair value gap If
33:54
we see in this example right here we see a large fair value gap that displace through this high Now disclaimer guys
33:59
nothing's 100% Like I told you yes we expect the market to continue through a
34:05
high if we've displaced So like right here we displace this high So you'd say okay well this is the the the target Now
34:12
there's going to be people in the comments saying "Oh my god it doesn't work every time." Of course nothing works every time guys Disclaimer sorry
34:18
There is no 100% win rate holy grail strategy There's your holy grail there But how do we tell when this is likely
34:23
to fail Well if the fair value gap that broke structure gets inverted or really
34:29
any fair value gap when it gets inverted that tells us that the market is weak because in a bullish market we don't
34:34
want to see these fair value gaps getting inverted We always look at the market in the sense of really just key
34:40
levels and confirmation Okay guys you'll see this theme repeated through today
34:45
but at all times you're just different ways of finding these two things No matter if you trade ICT or if you trade
34:51
some other way of trading it's all coming down to where you mark key levels or how you do it which we talked about
34:56
earlier which is the where you do business in the market and then what you want to happen Now the what the
35:03
confirmation is how you react to fair value gaps candle bodies and highs and lows And we're going to get into all the
35:08
different confirmation patterns but this for now is the first one which is an inverted fair value gap So if you're inverting a fair value gap you're going
35:15
to expect the market to then move to the downside But you only want to pay attention to these for any kind of
35:20
execution once you've hit a key level Now once we've hit this key level right here which is a timebased level and
35:26
we're going to go into how to mark those later you would be then watching to see if we invert a fair value gap Because if
35:32
you've hit a key level and you have a confirmation like this inverse fair value gap you see right here Cool Now
35:40
that is going to be a high probability that the market's likely going to reverse because inverted fair value gaps
35:46
or any confirmation pattern that the market's reversing need to happen at a
35:51
key level This this is everything guys If you just delete this level and you would have seen this sure it might work
35:56
sometimes but you're just gambling You have to understand the context of these patterns or you're no better than
36:02
someone trading bull flags Now let's go into the next kind of key level which is going to be price delivery And this is
36:08
one that gets confused by a lot of people and I'm going to show you a simple hack that can help you never get this wrong So price delivery tells us
36:15
whether the market is targeting highs or lows Okay If you're in bullish price delivery the market is seeking out highs
36:22
meaning it's seeking out liquidity above And vice versa if you're bearish it's currently delivering lower Yeah very
36:27
groundbreaking info right But this is super powerful because whenever price shifts delivery at a key level a
36:33
reversal is likely Now price delivery is the foundation for all price levels outside of fair value gaps Now I want
36:38
you to pay attention to how we're reacting to candle bodies Okay for price delivery candle bodies are everything
36:44
Right here we engulf these up close candle bodies Okay so we have down
36:49
candles engulfing up close candles We have another uplo candle print right here down close candles engulf it Same
36:57
thing right here where an uplo candle prints down close candle engulfves it However you then hit to a key level and
37:03
then what happens These down close candles get engulfed by a bullish candle Now this right here is enough to enter a
37:11
trade This is one of my most favorite powerful entry models you can use because it gives you better risk-to-reward than any of the other key
37:18
levels Now when you pair it with an inverted fair value gap like you have right here it's extremely powerful and
37:24
it can give you an early entry to catch better trades Now an easy way to learn these is if you want to go back to your
37:30
charts you can go to the settings up here You can turn off the wicks and then
37:36
just look at the candle bodies This tells you everything you need to know And the reason this is powerful is because you want to understand what side
37:41
of the market is getting trapped Going back to what we were saying earlier the volume of most candles is in the body So
37:48
if you look at it like this like if we're going into this this level right here all of the volume of all these
37:54
sellers is going to be in these bodies So if we see bullish price momentum close above where the bulk of traders
38:00
are at because we understand the bulk of traders are in the bodies and we know that we're now closing above them you
38:07
could say that these traders are underwater and then if the market comes back down into them then we're likely to
38:13
move away from it because we don't want to let those traders get out for a win So for example whenever you're talking
38:19
about liquidity you want to see the opposing side of the market off sides or in the red So if people are selling all
38:25
through this area and you know that the majority of sellers are positioned at least in these bodies okay yes there are
38:31
going to be people up here but most of them are right here If the market goes back above them they're now underwater and if they get the chance to they're
38:37
likely to get out for break even This is going to create buying pressure because the people who are in sells are exiting
38:44
which is the equivalent of a buy That's why in a bullish market you will see the market find support on down close
38:50
candles And you'll see this pattern repeat itself until the market's bearish Now you don't want to pay attention to
38:56
every single one of these You mainly want to pay attention to the ones that happen at key levels Again guys key
39:01
levels and confirmations Okay this this tells you everything you need to know and you'll be able to summarize pretty
39:07
much everything you learn when it comes to analysis into one of these two things and everything else is noise And that
39:14
brings us to one of the most popular ICT concepts which is an order block So an order block is created whenever price
39:20
shifts delivery with force and it leaves behind a key level Now we've already just explained why order blocks work so
39:26
I won't spend a ton of time on them But really you need to understand that in a bearish market upclose candles are going
39:32
to be used as resistance and you can look to trade from them Now you always want to pay attention to ones that hit
39:37
into a key level because as with anything again the stuff you see happen at key levels is what's important You
39:43
don't want to pay attention to every single order block or every single fair value gap if you want to be profitable Now some tricks with order blocks is
39:49
that they must be followed with displacement the highest probability ones are going to create fair value gaps as price moves away from them Now to be
39:56
clear not all order blocks are created equal And after watching thousands and thousands of candles print I came up
40:01
with a much better way to pick which order blocks you're going to trade from Now I've taught you guys a ton of
40:07
different key levels And if you've been trading for any period of time that you understand not all key levels work and
40:13
I've told you guys that So how do we understand and determine which liquidity actually matters or which levels
40:19
actually matter and which is just noise Now price is going to be subjective
40:25
meaning that whenever people look at the markets you and I might see them in a different way and there's no factual way
40:31
to say who is right or wrong However there is one filter that we have access to as traders that is fully mechanical
40:38
and this was the biggest breakthrough in my trading career and that is timebased
40:43
liquidity Okay most of you who have been struggling with ICT or those of you who are new and learning this you're
40:49
probably wondering how do we know which highs and lows to pick How do we know where I should sell where I should buy
40:55
And this was me for so many years I would understand these concepts and I just couldn't figure out which levels
41:00
and which lows and which highs And it was so taunting because I knew there was something here but I didn't understand
41:07
how to filter out the nonsense and how to be able to take the high probability trades So you might feel like oh well
41:13
it's random which highs and lows we move from but that is not the case The market is not random and time plays a bigger
41:20
role than you realize Now this is something that gets put around the ICT community and people try to be all
41:26
mysterious about it and act like it's some enigmatic thing I'm going to simplify it for you guys so you can
41:32
eliminate all the noise But I want you guys to understand first and foremost that every big move in the markets Every
41:38
single one happens around timebased liquidity Now there are patterns that repeat across the week
41:45
across the day across the session And this reveals where the highest amount of liquidity sits and it helps you have a
41:51
mechanical way of picking highs and lows and fair value gaps and every other level that you will learn here today But
41:58
before we get into timebased liquidity I want to teach you guys something called SMT divergence So really simple stuff
42:04
guys Whenever you have markets that are correlated so for example if we have NASDAQ which is what I've been showing
42:10
you this whole time NASDAQ is correlated with ES okay and YM and this is the S&P
42:16
500 This is the Dow Jones index So the stock market usually moves together The different indices move together So let's
42:22
just say we have NASDAQ here on the left and ES on the right Now what you're expecting is these markets if one of
42:27
them is making higher highs and higher lows you're expecting the other one to do it too However if you see one of them
42:34
make a lower low while the other is making higher lows that is going to be a
42:40
divergence meaning there is difference at the lows Now anything you see where the lows are being messed with we know
42:46
is bullish because smart money manipulates lows to buy So in this example right here we notice there's a
42:52
higher low right here on the NASDAQ However there's a lower low on ES Now
42:59
what does this mean Well this means that this move lower is likely just a manipulation in order for smart money to
43:05
get positioned And if smart money is getting positioned on the lows that means we're likely to go higher Okay
43:10
This is a pattern you'll see repeat itself time and time again and can be used as a complement to the other
43:15
concepts we use For example if you come into the market and you see something like this happening then you know the
43:21
market's likely to be bullish Now another example of this is let's just say you're trading a forex currency like
43:26
the Euro dollar and it is making a higher high Well if you're looking at
43:31
the dollar on the left what you would expect is it to make a lower low because they move inversely However if there's a
43:38
break in that correlation that is SMT divergence in its own And that signals that a large move is likely to take
43:44
place But I want to be clear that the key isn't just spotting SMT divergence It's knowing exactly where and when it
43:51
matters And time is going to help you do this with even more precision than price alone Now here's another example at the
43:58
highs A lot of times people ask me if I show an example just on the lows they'll they'll ask for an example on the highs
44:03
It's always the same thing but if you see right here one chart made a higher high This was ES And then on NASDAQ we
44:08
made a lower high This paired with other concepts can be used as a confluence that the market is likely to trade down
44:15
Now there is a lot of people that'll say that one is better to trade Like some people say the one that made a lower high is weaker Some people say the one
44:22
that made a higher high that's manipulation You know the way I look at it it really doesn't matter Um in my
44:27
opinion I just trade whichever one has the better setup Usually for me it's NASDAQ All right guys So if you want a
44:33
cheat sheet for different correlated markets I'm not going to read every single one of them out but you can pause this take a picture of your phone take a
44:39
screenshot whatever Um these are the different markets that should move together And then here are the markets
44:44
that are inversely correlated This is what I was talking about like with the Euro dollar versus DXY which is the US
44:50
dollar If you ever want to look at the US dollar on a chart you would type in DXY Um you could use it versus gold
44:56
Another thing you can use is bonds versus equities But anyways I'll let you screenshot this and you can use this as
45:02
a cheat sheet All right Next I want to teach you guys one of the cornerstones of ICT and how to trade different price
45:08
legs So this is called a market maker model You've probably seen this before It gets over complicated all the time
45:14
All this is is a strategy to visualize retracements and expansions on a lower time frame All right guys It's not that
45:20
complicated People make it out like they have all these big words I I didn't draw this Like I don't come up with these names Distribution redistribution SMR
45:27
Like you don't need any of that okay All you need to understand is what side of the curve we're on Okay Like if we hit a
45:32
higher time frame key level on a lower time frame you're just looking for a reversal from it is one of the most over
45:38
complicated things But um I want to teach it to you not even because um you need to understand market maker models
45:44
It's more so to simplify because a lot of the stuff you've learned is just over complicated All it is is once you hit a
45:49
higher time frame key level on the lower time frame you're going to have consolidations on the way down to it There's going to be liquidity at these
45:56
areas and then there's going to be some original consolidation where that higher time frame originally started reversing
46:02
from And really that the power in this is it helps you avoid overtrading and hold good trades longer because you know
46:07
if you're expecting the market to move all the way up here what it does is it shows that once you hit one key level okay you look for this entry pattern and
46:15
once you've got your change of the state of delivery maybe there's an inverse fair value gap maybe there is a fair
46:20
value gap and a displacement Whatever it is all this says is like once you've traded from one key level you're
46:26
identifying that you're moving to the next Now I'm going to show you how to use timebased levels to be able to
46:31
filter out a lot of the noise because a lot of people get confused marking the key levels And if you do that you're done from the start But once you have a
46:38
simple way to do that and you see this confirmation anytime the market moves in your direction people will then FOMO and
46:45
they'll wait They'll get in a long up here and as soon as we get a down move they get scared When really this is
46:50
where you should be either adding to your trade or trailing your stop loss So for example let's say you get in a trade
46:56
down here If you see this pattern like you're in a long and it moves up you see a consolidation and it jabs under it and
47:03
then displaces up like what that's telling you is that again like we talked about from the beginning of the video the way we react to lows and highs tells
47:10
you everything you need to know In this example we manipulated the low and moved higher This shows us that we're bullish
47:17
Now if the market moved down and then pushed to this high that's an area where you can put your stop loss okay Because
47:23
the market has now swept liquidity and it's moving higher And you'll see this pattern repeat again and again Now one of the ways that you can look for market
47:29
maker models is whenever you trade into a fair value gap So in this example we trade under the fair value gap right
47:35
here And on the lower time frame this wick was a market maker model And this is going to be how you execute on these
47:42
moves from internal range liquidity to external range liquidity So this is the exact same fair value gap right here The
47:48
chart I just showed you was the weekly and this is what it looked like on the 4 hour So I want you guys to use the same alignment that I told you earlier in the
47:54
video whenever it comes to IRL on the left and then looking for the market maker model on the right So if we look
48:01
right here the market hit into that weekly fair value gap So this is going to be a 4hour chart Now what we're
48:07
looking for is the market to hit into that fair value gap after we've swept the low and then we want to get some
48:12
kind of confirmation Again key levels and confirmation guys Notice right here we get that change in the state of
48:18
delivery As soon as this happens remember we're expecting these down close candles to act as support And you
48:25
could look to execute trades from this And as we see the market trades down into it and then moves higher And
48:31
anytime the market does this from internal range liquidity we know it's likely to go to that external range
48:38
liquidity So again in this higher time frame all it looked like was this The market traded into that internal range
48:43
liquidity you go on a lower time frame find the market maker model and then you know the market's likely to move to
48:48
external range liquidity Now the reason we were looking for this in the first place is because the market was displacing highs So we expect the market
48:55
to move higher Now you could take this even a step further because as you notice there's fair value gaps in this
49:00
move And once you identify that you're on the buy side of the curve meaning you're moving up and where do you
49:07
identify that Well as soon as you get this change in the state of delivery so anything to the right of this you would
49:12
look at if we're hitting a low or if we're hitting any kind of support level you could look for the lower time frame
49:18
for what If you guessed another market maker model you're right So let's take a look at this wick on the next time frame
49:25
down Now for this example we started on the weekly then we went to the 4 hour So if we start on the 4 hour we're then
49:31
going to go to the 15minute So this is that wick that traded into that 4hour
49:36
fair value gap And what do you see You see a displacement You have a change in the state of delivery And notice how
49:42
these down closed candles act as support So when everything's aligned you can only look at one side of the market and
49:48
have confidence Now as soon as you got this change in the state of delivery look at that as a line in the sand Everything to the right you now can
49:54
expect those key levels to work And as we see this order block worked This is how you're going to be able to trade
50:00
with a lot of confidence Now in the other example this was the external
50:05
range liquidity So if you take a look right here we had internal which was this low So where's the external It's
50:11
right there And that is what I have marked out right here So you can just break down price action on lower time
50:17
frames and get a different view but it's really all the same thing The market's always moving from internal range
50:22
liquidity to external But when you have multiple time frames aligned that is when you can have confidence that your
50:27
key levels like order blocks and fair value gaps are likely to work Now we've went over liquidity we've went over
50:34
market structure and you have a decent idea of how price moves but the most
50:39
important question is do you know when And this is the most important part of
50:45
everything that you will learn when it comes to ICT And I remember like yesterday it literally gives me chills
50:52
thinking about this All the mistakes I made I mean I learned this for years And I didn't have anybody to help tell me this I had to figure this out on my own
50:58
after losing a ton of money And I almost gave up on ICT I almost thought this stuff doesn't work It's I
51:05
thought all those things But then once I realized that there was such a simple thing hidden under my nose the whole
51:12
time that fixed all the mistakes that I made once I figured out this one thing this is when my trading finally took a
51:18
turn and I became profitable And let me tell you guys when you become a profitable trader it's not like any other business Like any other business
51:25
it's kind of like you have this gradual come up Usually trading is like you get lucky you go through a really deep dark
51:32
time you think about quitting And this is where a lot of you guys are at right now Okay This is where a lot of you guys are at And it's okay You're not alone I
51:39
was in the exact same boat I almost gave it up multiple times I took breaks from trading even But once you finally become
51:48
profitable it is the biggest bull market you've ever seen Because once you have this skill once you can filter out what
51:54
is likely to happen and what isn't and you have confidence your entire life changes overnight Now to be clear before
52:00
we break this down if you can't execute it daily then it doesn't matter So in
52:05
the study guide if you downloaded it if you didn't download it go and download it and shame on you for not taking this
52:10
seriously But in the study guide you will see in the resource library a trading plan because yes there's a study
52:16
guide there's a resource library there's a free community there's all that stuff that's going to help you become profitable But in the trading plan it
52:23
gives you a very systematic process how to mark out key levels and we're going to get into how to plan scenarios Now a
52:30
big mistake ICT traders make is they always want to talk about bias They always want to talk about daily bias And
52:35
we're going to get into why not to use daily bias later but for now I want to give you guys some words of reassurance
52:41
okay Because you have to understand like all the stuff I've taught you today it's all great It can make you money all this
52:47
Yes But if you don't have a system then it's just random You're just gambling Okay This is where most traders get
52:53
stuck forever Most traders they learn the concepts and they know all these different things but when they sit down
52:58
and it's time to make money they hesitate They overthink they freeze or even worse they just start taking random
53:05
trades So what I want to teach you now guys you know people might say it's boring but let me be clear When trading
53:10
becomes boring that is when you know you've made it Because if it's exciting you're gambling Okay Now all of us get
53:17
into trading because we like gambling Let's be honest we're all gamblers at heart But you have to be able to be a
53:23
control gambler And it shouldn't be excited anymore You shouldn't be all hyped up Trading should become very very
53:29
very boring And it is boring I get more joy out of doing this right here what
53:34
I'm doing right now talking to a camera talking to you guys than I do trading ever It doesn't matter how much money I
53:40
make or how much money I lose because it's all the same after a while But I know that if I can give you guys
53:45
something that can help you guys get further along than what I had whenever I was in your position that's giving me
53:52
more excitement and joy than trading ever will be able to again because now after I've systematized it it's it's
53:58
numb I want to be clear that this is what makes the difference between someone who knows how the market works
54:03
and someone who actually profits from it Yes those are two different things This is why you see people who are these
54:08
Twitter analysts who can draw out the chart and call where it's going but you never see them post a a blip of profit
54:15
You don't even see anything that proves they're actually making money Now to be clear there are two things you need to
54:21
become a profitable trader That is a standard operating procedure that removes emotion and makes trading
54:27
repeatable Because no matter how much you know if you don't have rules that are set out for you when you get to your
54:32
desk there will be an emotional filter on things You come into the market you see traders trading daily bias and they
54:38
come into the market ignoring half the information that's there Now you also need a mechanical strategy that gives
54:44
you clarity on exactly when where and what you need in order to execute and
54:49
exit trades So the difference between these two because I get a lot of questions about this The SOP is everything outside of entry Okay Like
54:56
how do you go about your morning routine How do you journal your trades How do you manage risk How do you go at prop
55:02
firm challenges All of these things This is what really matters and nobody talks about online Everybody just wants to
55:07
draw chart patterns cuz that's what people like I mean I see in my retention graphs but I didn't make this whole
55:13
project as a retention thing As you can see I don't even know how long we've been going now But I made this to make
55:18
profitable traders So if this kind of stuff bores you then we probably won't get along because I'm in the business of
55:23
being a professional and I want to work with professionals This is the process that builds consistency before and after
55:29
you touch the chart This is pre-trade post trade how you mark your levels confirmation filters how you're going to
55:36
risk your stop-loss rules all of this And this is what really removes emotion and hesitation because you can have your
55:41
trading strategy And if you don't have this then you can still be an emotional wreck with a strategy Because all a
55:46
trading strategy really does it helps you execute mechanically It's your entry model What makes you pull the trigger
55:53
Now once this is locked in you're not really just analyzing the markets anymore Like sure everything you've learned today comes together and you
55:59
have an awareness of it but you're not going to look at every single level on the chart because you're not trying to catch every single move You're trying to
56:05
have a system that makes you money in the long term You don't want to be guessing around or just like drawing lines on a chart because that gets you
56:11
what I like to call decision fatigue And this is where most ICT traders get stuck forever And you might be here right now
56:17
Chances are you are and I was here for years because you learn all these different concepts and you see that they work and you don't know when to actually
56:24
use them and when not to So having a system is very important because it tells you exactly what to do So my
56:29
pre-trade process is pretty simple Now this is in the notion you got with the study guide But basically I like to
56:35
start 30 minutes before the market opens and mark out key levels understand different conditions like are we going
56:42
to expand Are we likely to consolidate This way I know what I'm going to be risking for the day And we'll get to
56:47
that in the risk management session But I also like to check for major news or earnings You could go to forexfactory.com and do this Now Forex
56:55
Factory is a website It looks like this You could turn it on And what you would do is you basically go into the filters
57:01
and you would pick any of the markets you're trading If you're just trading futures you would just have USD checked Uh if you're trading forex you could
57:07
pick whichever pairs Personally I just turn on the red folder I don't pay attention to anything else And a lot of
57:13
traders will tell you to stay away from this They'll say "Don't ever trade red folder news." It's the stupidest piece of advice Like obviously don't trade
57:20
right before CPI or something Don't be a freaking idiot But I want to have red folder news on the days that I'm trading
57:26
because I know that those days are likely to be more expansive If there's no red folder news I'm likely going to go in and risk less because I know these
57:33
markets are likely to be chopping around And it's not to say anything is absolute Like you can have boring days on a red
57:39
folder news day You can have expansive days when there's no news But it does give you a little bit of a filter So you need to always look at this every day
57:46
before you trade And if you're trading prop firms you need to know this cuz some of them you could fail your challenge if you're trading with the
57:52
news Um you also need to make sure you're not in a trade right before the news happens because you can get slipped
57:58
Now when I say getting slipped I'm going to show you what I mean Let's just say you entered a trade right here and you put your stops at this high Okay And
58:05
let's just say the market gives you a big nice FU candle massively pushes past
58:10
your stop Well if this candle moves too fast through your stop then you might actually lose more than you plan to lose
58:15
This is more likely to happen during red fold or news events because what happens is there's less liquidity because smart
58:22
traders they're kind of sitting back waiting for it to settle down and that means that there might not be somebody to fill your order So the market could
58:28
expand through it and you lose way more than you are planning to lose So that's why you don't want to be in a trade
58:34
right before red folder news Now I want to be clear that not all red folder news is created equal For example if you have
58:40
something like consumer sentiment it's different than if you have the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Pal speaking
58:46
Okay The big ones you want to watch out for are NFP CPI which is inflation FOMC
58:53
which is basically the interest rates coming out and not just any FOMC Um you want to make sure it's the not the
59:00
minutes The minutes don't really matter as much Sometimes they can but I don't really pay attention to those It's the
59:05
interest rates okay The federal funding rates Whenever you get federal funding rates coming out those are the ones that
59:11
you want to really pay attention to So for example this one right here you'll have a lot of news events It's always at
59:16
2 p.m These are like the most important news drivers in the markets because this
59:21
is how everything else in the economy is read by smart money Now a couple tips If
59:27
you see the forecast right like this is what economists are planning is going to happen You're not going to have the
59:32
actual until after the news comes out But for interest rates if the actual is the same or lower than the forecast that
59:39
is bullish If it comes out higher then it's extremely bearish Now the reason for this is basically this is the Fed's
59:46
way of setting the price of money Now I know that may sound crazy but essentially this is basically the rates
59:52
at which the biggest banks can take loans at And I'm not going to get into that Somebody will probably correct me in the comments but if you guys want to
59:58
learn macroeconomics go get a buck or something Now inflation is another thing
1:00:03
that is very very impactful in the market So when we have inflation it's going to be CPI The one you really pay attention to is this year-over-year I
1:00:10
mean they're all important but for example notice how right here the CPI was lower than expected Now what this
1:00:18
means if you see red on here this can be confusing because this means bearish for the dollar But if it's bearish for the
1:00:24
dollar and and stock markets move inverse to the dollar then that means it's bullish for the stock markets Now
1:00:30
this isn't foolproof It's not 100% but usually inflation going down lower means
1:00:35
that the markets are likely to be more bullish Now the news is just one way you're going to identify the session
1:00:41
narrative I'm going to show you some other ways as well but it's really important that you go in and have an idea of your surroundings Now next we're
1:00:48
going to be building out scenarios Now I want you to be very very very careful that you never get stuck in a bias A lot
1:00:55
of ICT traders and ICT himself will tell you like daily bias and it's just this stupid term that makes so many people
1:01:02
unprofitable Basically it's saying which way is the daily candle going to close Like if you're trading the one minute which most of you guys are trading the
1:01:08
one or five minute if you're trading propers you don't need to know that Okay You just need to understand how to have a system that gives you key levels and
1:01:15
plot reactions from them Okay So I want to be very clear guys Don't roll out of bed and try to trade right when you wake
1:01:22
up or something like rubbing your eyes not being a professional at that point If your brain isn't ready your trades won't be either So I always like to say
1:01:28
if I don't get good sleep if I don't follow my morning routine then I don't trade Now look I'm not saying you have to wake up and go run a mile or
1:01:35
or get in the cold plunge or be David Gogggins I mean just wake up a little early have a little bit of mindfulness
1:01:40
practice without your phone Like I just like to write down what I'm grateful for meditate a little bit get ready for the
1:01:46
day You don't have to you know I'm not saying you have to run a marathon or something okay But it needs to be intentional And the reason is
1:01:51
because you're basically forming the identity of a professional You're saying "I'm taking this serious." You're putting yourself in the right state of
1:01:57
mind to succeed Now I know I've shown you guys a lot of different levels And in the study guide and the resources you
1:02:04
will see these sets of levels Now I want to be clear This is all you need to mark
1:02:10
Okay These are going to be all the levels that you actually pay attention to on the higher time frame We don't
1:02:16
need a bias other than that We're going to use the different concepts that I've taught you on the lower time frames to
1:02:21
confirm if we're moving away from these levels So you need to go through your charts every morning and mark out all of
1:02:28
these levels And these are going to be areas we look at the market as our where to trade Now I'm going to break this
1:02:34
down on a chart in a second but for now go ahead and make sure if you didn't already download the study guide or just
1:02:39
take a screenshot of this so you have these levels on something where you can save it for later So for example it's
1:02:44
Saturday when I'm recording this but let's just say you're coming into the market and you need to mark out all these levels So what you could do is go
1:02:51
to the weekly chart first And what you're going to want to do is mark out the high and mark out the low Now me
1:02:57
personally I like having these colorcoded If you go into Trading View you can set templates So like if you go
1:03:03
to this setting after you select a level pick templates Now I already have mine set up where it's just a different color
1:03:10
for the weekly daily level What you would do is like let's just say if you wanted to have weekly okay you would
1:03:15
type it in here after you doubleclick a line or any other box you've drawn on Trading View and you would click
1:03:20
template and save as Now for the weekly and daily levels I just have them as purple That way when I'm on my lower
1:03:26
time frames I know which levels that are going to be from the higher time frame Next you're going to go down to your
1:03:31
daily chart and then you can mark out these levels as well which is going to be the previous days high and low Now it
1:03:37
looks like I'm marking out the current day but that's just because I'm on replay mode And you can label these as
1:03:43
previous daily high or previous daily low Okay Now these are going to be high
1:03:48
amounts of liquidity Okay This is where we get into the timebased liquidity stuff So I need you guys to pay close attention So you've marked out the
1:03:54
previous week's high and low You've marked out the previous days high and low Now the current week we don't have because the market hasn't opened yet but
1:04:00
every day you'd want to make sure you're at least aware of where that is Now the next thing is going to be the Asia and
1:04:05
the London session high and low Now to do this you're going to go to the 15-minute chart and then you're going to
1:04:11
go over to the left and you're going to drop down this lines menu right here and go to vertical line Now before you guys
1:04:17
raid the comments and tell me I'm marking this wrong look I mark the levels on what works for me okay I don't
1:04:24
go by what people usually call the London and Asia session And if you mark your charts you will see why okay
1:04:31
Thousands of people online have gotten profitable trading the strategy You can check the comments on my videos You see it all over my social media You see what
1:04:37
I'm doing I showed you my results at the beginning of the video This works Okay So please don't tell me you know
1:04:44
actually the London low is no Okay If you don't want to trade what I trade that's fine But everybody always puts in
1:04:50
the comments that I'm wrong It's kind of funny Now anyways you're going to put these lines at midnight 6:00 a.m and
1:04:57
6:00 p.m the previous night Now what you just did was you marked out the Asia and
1:05:03
the London session Okay Now these are going to be very high amounts of liquidity in these zones So to be clear
1:05:09
let's just say if you were coming in to actually trade a day which we're going to walk through the whole strategy later you would mark out these sessions and
1:05:15
then you'd mark out the highs and the lows of these sessions So these are going to be areas we look at for high
1:05:21
probability trades We'll get into this later but for now I just want to kind of implant in your head which levels you're
1:05:26
going to mark Next you're going to want to mark out the 1 hour 4 hour and daily swing points and fair value gaps Okay if
1:05:33
you want to keep your charts a little cleaner you don't have to mark out every single one but it's good to be aware you know like where are daily fair value
1:05:39
gaps So usually you could probably have done this first So you'd want to mark out and say okay well there's a daily
1:05:44
fair value gap above there's a daily swing point down below and you'd want to do this for your 4our charts and your 1
1:05:52
hour charts And this just gives you levels that you can look at to take trades which I'm going to show you here in a little bit on how to execute
1:05:58
mechanically Now what you're going to be doing with these levels is just marking them out and then marking out scenarios okay And not a bias okay Like the
1:06:04
biggest thing you can't do is say "Okay well you know I I I'm only bullish or
1:06:09
I'm only bearish." Because if you do this it is the fastest way to blind yourself from what the market is
1:06:15
actually doing Okay The market doesn't owe you or your plan Your job is to react not predict A lot of people get
1:06:21
this wrong I think the stock market and trading is all about predicting And yes to a point you're going to predict where
1:06:27
where the market's going to go when you're entering but like not on the grand scheme of things You need to have again like I talked about before you
1:06:33
have your key levels And if the market's not at your key levels you're not trying to predict all the time which one's
1:06:39
going to get hit You want to see one get hit first tell you if we're moving away from it and then just look to trade
1:06:44
towards the other one Okay We're going to go through a way to do this but cannot stress this enough because once you lock your brain into a bias your
1:06:51
brain just filters for confirmations and you ignore anything that contradicts against that bias So let me give you an
1:06:57
example of what I mean with scenarios Okay guys so this was on a day where I made 8,000 bucks and I took a total of
1:07:04
six trades Now I didn't come into the market with the bias I came into the market and just looked at different areas and I said "Okay well this new
1:07:11
week's opening gap is likely to get tapped." But I wasn't just sticking into it right Then I went to the 4 hour and I
1:07:16
marked out those same levels we just talked about the London high the 4hour fair value gap the inflection point and
1:07:22
I start to build an idea I'm not completely sold on any side of the market For example like let's just say
1:07:28
the market hit into this level right here and I saw no reaction to go to the upside Well then I'm going to say cool I
1:07:34
guess I was wrong and I'm going to look to trade into the lows You don't want to always just have you know it has to be
1:07:40
one side or you can't take any trades or it has to be the other You just want to look at the market in a sense of how do
1:07:45
I map out the key levels of where I want to do business and then what do I look at these levels whether it's a
1:07:50
continuation or a reversal So you want to map out these scenarios You can do this in Tradzella I'll leave a link down
1:07:56
in the description to get a discount to Trade Zela But I cannot stress enough how you need to go through and map out
1:08:02
like what are the different things that can happen Okay Not always mapping out oh well I'm only bullish today I'm only
1:08:08
bearish because that just blinds you from what the market's actually doing Because when you're trading like if you're trading the New York session you
1:08:14
need to pay attention to what the New York session is telling you What kind of highs and lows are we hitting How is the market reacting to them How does the
1:08:20
market react to timebased levels And then you can trade whether or not it's a continuation or a reversal But if you
1:08:27
get stuck in one side you only look for continuation or you only look for reversal And it's never good to not have
1:08:32
an objective perspective on the market You have to remain objective and not get stuck in a bias Now of course you can
1:08:38
lean in one direction to adjust risk like you might be leaning bullish and if you see what you want to see you're more
1:08:45
you know likely to take higher risk on that trade And then vice versa if you don't see what you're expecting you might still take a trade but you peel
1:08:52
back a little bit on risk cuz it's not what you were expecting But you should be never scared to flip sides in the market A lot of people think this is
1:08:57
unprofessional or something but it's it's just it's how the market works You're not going to always get this right I can't tell you how many times
1:09:04
that I was completely wrong on the day but I made a tremendous amount of money simply because I wasn't being stubborn
1:09:10
Now for your post-trade process I highly recommend you do use Tradezella Again
1:09:15
that link is in the description But regardless if you do or not I also gave you a free trade journal in the study
1:09:21
guide packet So what I want you guys to do the big things here like obviously log the basics right Like that that's
1:09:26
obvious but you want to mark the setup and that way you can take a look like what is the probability of an inversion fair value gap entry versus an order
1:09:33
block right Another thing that is really really important guys is the time
1:09:38
because if you look and see okay well what time of day am I most profitable
1:09:43
and then you know which time you're not like for example if you can identify that between 9:45 and 10 a.m you take
1:09:50
half the losses you take and you just don't trade during that time boom you just became profitable You see you don't
1:09:56
see all these gurus talk about this stuff online because it may not sound sexy but those are the real things you
1:10:01
need to understand in order to trade like a professional in order to become profitable It's not just about picking
1:10:06
every market move and calling the tops and bottoms A lot of it's the boring stuff like when you get to a certain point that's really the big levers you
1:10:14
can pull You can also track your emotional state you know all these other obvious things that most people talk
1:10:19
about journaling Um but if you're not filtering your data then it doesn't matter Like if you're unprofitable
1:10:24
people journal and they're like "Oh I look at my trading journal I'm unprofitable." It's like that doesn't help you Where are you the most
1:10:30
unprofitable Where are you the most profitable What times of day What setups You see this is how you're supposed to
1:10:35
journal And Tradzella you can do this It's amazing It's sick It does all this for you But again you can get the access
1:10:42
to my trading journal for free if you don't want to buy anything All right guys So we've talked a lot about key levels and when to trade and where to
1:10:49
trade and all this stuff but what does it really mean when you get confirmation Now a lot of you guys will only think
1:10:56
about the market in a sense of reversals ICT trains us to look for liquidity And
1:11:02
I know that we've talked about the markets being manipulated but a big thing that you guys have to understand is yes sometimes the market's going to
1:11:09
reverse but as we know the market's not going to hit into every single level and
1:11:14
give you your picture perfect reversal And sometimes you'll get it and the market might shift to the upside but
1:11:20
then what happens It fails And you might lose trades because of this However there's also a way you can turn these
1:11:27
losses into massive wins So I want to be very clear when I say confirmation it's
1:11:32
different than you've heard from your average ICT guru because this can be either a reversal or what I like to call
1:11:39
a flip So when we talk about confirmation and we sum up everything you've learned into those two things I
1:11:45
said earlier right Everything comes into key levels and confirmation Everything fair value gaps market structure all
1:11:52
this stuff It's just helping you find these two things This is why most people get stuck with ICT because they try to
1:11:57
learn bias But once you've traded into one key level and you have a confirmation of what's going to happen
1:12:03
it's never 100% but for example right here let's just say you had a fair value
1:12:08
gap right here and it got inverted Any kind of bearish signature in price that's occurring at a key level That is
1:12:15
telling you that key level is strong and that smart money is selling from it So at that time you can take a sell once
1:12:21
you get that confirmation put a stop above the recent high and trade to the low Now it can get more precise than
1:12:28
that but essentially that's what we're doing Now other things you can do is along the way like we talked about with
1:12:35
market maker models we're going to see the market sweep liquidity along the way
1:12:40
against our direction So if we're bearish and we see highs get swept remember all the way back to the
1:12:46
beginning of what I taught you guys today Watch how the market reacts with highs and lows So we've hit this high
1:12:51
how did the market react to it Then how did the market react with lows You see manipulation versus displacement Now at
1:12:57
this time let's just say you're in a trade from here you could then move your stop loss up above that high because
1:13:04
we've had a stop run And if there's a stop run and we continue down lower you shouldn't have to have another stop run
1:13:09
The same thing goes for right here Now you also not only can move your stops up but when you get another confirmation
1:13:16
you can enter another trade because you're basically just trading this range from one key level to the next because
1:13:21
again key levels confirmation Now in this example we have a reversal but look down here The market started to reverse
1:13:28
and you maybe even took a long position right here right I I'll show you guys some trades where I had a long that I
1:13:35
took or you know whatever trade I took as a reverse one it was wrong And then this tells me like okay well if the
1:13:40
market's hitting a level it's showing me it wants to reverse but then aggressive sellers step in Most ICT traders just
1:13:47
are done trading They say I took a loss My bias told me we're bullish so I can't sell But I look at it like if this
1:13:53
level's failing then where are we likely to go Most likely there's some other level down below from the level list
1:13:59
that I gave you earlier And if you can identify that you have good enough risk-to-reward to trade from this level
1:14:06
and you can put your stop right here because this is the market telling you it's likely going to go lower Why would you not take that opportunity Because
1:14:12
you can recoup your loss And a lot of people be in the comments saying overtrading overtrading Look look at my
1:14:17
results Please post yours if you disagree with me Okay I promise you this works And this is one of the biggest breakthroughs that I had because I
1:14:23
stopped listening to what everybody said and started doing what actually worked for me And I encourage you guys look my
1:14:30
goal is not for you guys to be complete copies of me I want to give you guys what I learned and let you take it and
1:14:37
figure out how you can add other things that make more sense to you So I always like to use the quote from Bruce Lee You
1:14:42
take what's useful discard what isn't and add what is your own And that is what helped me become a profitable
1:14:48
trader not just listening to everything else that was told to me So you need to understand that the market's not always
1:14:53
going to reverse Sometimes you're going to have reversals Sometimes you're going to have flips You can make money off either one And sometimes you're going to
1:14:59
take a loss before you have to take a win And once you shift to this way of thinking you're now thinking from a
1:15:04
place of abundance You're not thinking of "Oh my god I have one shot." You don't really care and you don't you're
1:15:10
not afraid to take a trade because you know if you lose as long as you're taking a sound trade at a key level well
1:15:15
that loss is now turning to an opportunity I'm not going to say it's going to happen every time and I'm also not going to say you'll never not take
1:15:22
two losses right That's why we have the risk management we do And I'm going to show you guys how to pick you know how
1:15:27
many losses you allow yourself how to position size all this stuff But that's why we have those things And once you shift from a perspective of being scared
1:15:34
to a perspective of understanding that when you're wrong a good deal of the time there's a new opportunity all of
1:15:39
your little psychological issues start to evaporate because you don't really have trading psychology issues You just
1:15:44
don't know what the that you're actually doing So you have no confidence Okay guys like that That's something else that I had to realize along the way
1:15:51
too Now let's look at a couple different types of confirmation The most simple one is going to be a market structure
1:15:56
shift So when the market goes from making higher highs and higher lows it hits into a key level and it shifts down
1:16:02
lower creating a fair value gap Pretty simple We can take a look at this right here As you can see we had a low get
1:16:08
taken out with force with displacement We expect the market to move down lower Now this example is pretty pretty simple
1:16:14
okay There's better ways to confirm trades that can get you in much faster because in every single market structure shift there are four key things that
1:16:22
happen before the market structure shift There's an SFP there's an inverted fair value gap change in the state of
1:16:28
delivery We've already talked about these An SFP is just a swing failure pattern which I'll show you in a second
1:16:33
It's very simple And then a unicorn Now we'll get to that in one minute Now all a swing failure pattern is like in this
1:16:40
example let's just say we already have established we're likely to trade lower What you look for is how we react to
1:16:45
highs and whether or not we close beyond them Now it's a very aggressive way of trading But if you see a candle hit a high in a market where you're already
1:16:52
moving from one key level to the next and you see it just not even be able to close that's the first sign that we're
1:16:58
likely to continue lower then you'll likely have a change in the state of delivery which we see right here The
1:17:04
market engulfs this up close candle and you'll also likely see inverted fair value gaps Now all of these things
1:17:10
happen before you get a market structure shift and can allow you to get into trades much sooner because in this
1:17:15
example like you wouldn't even have got a trade if you look for a market structure shift because you didn't really displace through the low However
1:17:21
you can look at the market in a bearish sense because we already identified you're moving away from some other key
1:17:27
level So as soon as you get something like this you could enter a trade or you could wait for the inverted fair value
1:17:32
gap These are all just different ways of determining confirmation or a flip So some other examples of this we have this
1:17:38
market taking out a low right here And this blue box I drew is the area where traders are trapped Now the reason SFP
1:17:44
is usable is because we know that if the market is truly bullish anytime we come under a low that all the people who sold
1:17:51
under this low are just acting as liquidity So you don't really want to see the market hang out around these areas too long So if the market comes to
1:17:57
an SFP zone you're likely to move away from it Now I want to be clear the SFP is the earliest sign I prefer to use it
1:18:04
with other confluences The best way to use it is just look at your chart and see if you see a lot of them Like if you
1:18:09
see the market just always hitting lows and reacting very aggressively that's signs that you're bullish Now also this
1:18:15
can be signs you're in a bullish market maker model It's just you know again how is the market reacting to highs and lows
1:18:20
If you think about the market like that everything becomes much simpler There's all these complex terms It all comes down to how the market's reacting to
1:18:27
highs and lows because that's how the market is telling you what liquidity is being used and which liquidity is being
1:18:33
offered Now the reason most traders get stuck here is because they think that if a level fails that they just marked it
1:18:38
wrong or that they need to plan better or that their bias was wrong So what do they do They keep drawing more lines
1:18:44
they watch more videos they tweak their their setup until nothing makes sense and they're a nervous wreck And then you
1:18:50
get in this loop where you're stressed you're reactive you're overthinking and most of you guys right now are thinking
1:18:55
"Oh that's me." And you know how do I keep calling these things out It's cuz I used to be in the same position
1:19:00
Okay It is the worst cancer that gets spread through the ICT community You're
1:19:06
not wrong because a level didn't work You're wrong because you're not capitalizing off the level not working
1:19:11
And that's because you're attached to being right I don't care if I'm right I only care if I make money So we're going
1:19:16
to come back to why this happens But I want to make sure to show you something that changed my trading for good because
1:19:22
data is important Now I want to take a look at my metrics that I took from over 400 trades Now on the days where I
1:19:29
tagged that I traded with no daily bias my win rate was significantly higher
1:19:34
than when I was aligned with my daily bias This means if I was bullish on the day and I took longs my win rate was
1:19:40
only about 55% However when I wasn't sure what was happening and I came into
1:19:45
the market I had almost a 70% win rate Now this was from a long time ago and I
1:19:51
realized that bias was making me lose so much money Now I wasn't even profitable
1:19:56
at this time but see how looking at data can help you make those minor tweaks that make a world of difference And ever
1:20:02
since I stopped using bias I became way more profitable and trading became way less stressful My profit factor got
1:20:09
higher Now if you don't know what profit factor is it's for every $1 you put in what are you expecting to get out of
1:20:14
your trading strategy And I almost added a full $2 to this You can see I went from just under $2 to almost $3 simply
1:20:22
by removing daily bias Okay I was actually more profitable trading against my bias which I thought was crazy and I
1:20:28
would have never known this had I not reviewed my data Another thing too which is interesting is my average realize R
1:20:34
multiple Meaning like if I risk $1,000 on average I made more multiples of what
1:20:39
I risked when I didn't have daily bias Cuz when I had daily bias I was trading my predisposed plan in the market
1:20:45
instead of trading what the market was actually doing So how was it that I made more money on days where I had no bias
1:20:51
How is it that I was profitable when my bias was wrong This all comes down to a hidden flaw in the way that all traders
1:20:57
think about planning And it's something that most people fall victim to without even realizing I know that it took me
1:21:02
years to realize this And there's actually a phenomena for this It's called the IKEA effect Now this is what
1:21:08
most of your trading looks like You build a plan and then you trust the plan because you put effort into it Like
1:21:13
whenever you take a bunch of time and you make this perfect thing it's like when you make a piece of IKEA furniture
1:21:19
It's a piece of but you're in love with it because you spent time and effort in it You do the same thing with
1:21:24
your trading plan And whenever the plan works it's all happy golucky But whenever the market moves the opposite of your plan you just stick to it You
1:21:31
don't listen to the market You double down on your bias You say "I'm disciplined I'm a professional." And you
1:21:36
hesitate to actually trade against it because you feel like you're overtrading because you tried to sign yourself up
1:21:41
for one side of the market before you had a chance to see what the market was even going to do So you ignore every
1:21:46
sign you're wrong You only want the market to agree with your bias You'll take losses or miss winning trades and
1:21:52
you'll tell yourself "It's okay because I followed my plan because ICT told me a daily bias is good." It's so
1:21:58
stupid And so many people stay unprofitable simply because they do this Now you get frustrated You switch
1:22:05
strategies like most people because you think "Oh this doesn't work." No the problem is you Then you go do what You
1:22:11
go watch a new YouTube video You try to find some new shiny object And you restart the whole cycle What I want to
1:22:16
show you guys is how you can eliminate trying to plan because you don't need to know what's going to happen in the market before it does You just need to
1:22:23
know what levels are you trading from what do you look for at each level and how do you manage your trades and what do you need to enter and exit a trade
1:22:29
Past that everything is noise And a lot of people don't even know what a plan is Like a lot of people think a plan just
1:22:35
means predicting the market's direction When in reality a plan is just managing risk around multiple scenarios saying if
1:22:41
the market does this then I'll do this Not saying the market has to do this for me to trade And most people think "Oh
1:22:48
well a good plan is one that's right That means I did good." If I'm right look I'm wrong all the time on what I
1:22:54
think's going to happen but I can still make money And that's because I have a plan that provides a high probability of
1:23:00
success And most people don't even know what they're looking for Like they come into the market trying to have successful analysis I try to make money
1:23:07
Now I know a lot of you listening to this are like "What is this guy saying?" I know deep down you know what I'm saying is true You don't have to be
1:23:13
right on your analysis every day to make money Because a lot of times again when you're wrong the market's telling you
1:23:18
you're wrong there's a new opportunity And if you can detach from that fear of being wrong and be objective a whole new
1:23:25
world of opportunity opens up And you start to realize that success is just about profits not about being right You
1:23:31
don't have to be right more than you are wrong That's why we have multiples of risk-to-reward we take That's why we have risk management Now if this is the
1:23:37
case then why does everybody say you need to have a bias Well there's something called the Lindy effect Now
1:23:42
this means the more time something has been around the more probability of its existence Okay So if something has been
1:23:48
repeated time and time and time again the longer everybody just nods their head and agrees with it the longer it's
1:23:54
likely to stay around And people are just sheep This is how humans are They just believe anything Okay Go around
1:23:59
like look at anything People think that all sorts of nonsense People still think that fat's bad for you or that meat's
1:24:06
bad for you or all these things It's just been proven to not be true However people will just say it so people
1:24:11
believe it Now the Lindy effect is simply that the longer a piece of advice exists the more people assume that it
1:24:16
must be true And people just repeat it without questioning its validity and the intended message is lost Because I'm
1:24:22
sure at some point somebody who came up with this ideology that you need to have a plan what they meant was you need to
1:24:28
have scenarios a plan of what to do when you're wrong However people take it and it's like a game of telephone If you
1:24:33
tell somebody a story and they tell the next person and the next person the next person by the time it gets to the 10th person it's not even the same
1:24:39
story And that's the same thing with plans because everybody thinks that oh okay well you know I need to have a plan
1:24:45
of everything that's going to happen If it doesn't happen I'm not going to trade It's the dumbest worst plague I see
1:24:51
among new traders And think about it how many traders would agree and say "Oh yeah having a plan's good." Okay well if
1:24:57
a 100 traders start today 90 of them are going to blow their account in the first year Now out of the 10 that remain from
1:25:03
that original hundred nine of them are either going to break even or slowly bleed out over time That means that one
1:25:08
of these traders is truly going to make it One trader who is going to be consistently profitable and sustain in
1:25:14
the long run So why would you do what most traders do Now I want to be clear guys There is one thing that you can't
1:25:20
ignore and that is risk management Okay We don't use daily bias but we do use risk management because it doesn't
1:25:26
matter how good your strategy is Without risk management you will blow up And no risk management is not risking 1% per
1:25:32
trade That's something else that gets thrown around but we'll get to that later I want to be clear everybody goes through losses Like I went through a
1:25:37
losing streak recently where I took six losses in a row I was trading live in front of people There's a lot of
1:25:42
pressure on you but it didn't really matter because I was managing risk I understood when to peel my foot off the
1:25:47
gas So whenever I went on a losing streak I really didn't lose that much money and I was able to make it back in a very short amount of time Now most
1:25:54
traders fail because they size their position wrong And whenever they trade through bad conditions and they're not
1:26:00
limiting risk or not avoiding trades or they just treat every single setup the same odds are you're going to blow up
1:26:06
Because if you look like the probability of a losing streak now a lot of people will lie to you Like if you ask somebody like a guru and say "When's your last
1:26:12
losing streak?" And they say "I don't go on losing streaks." Just send them this screenshot because let's just say you have a 70% win rate which is really high
1:26:19
Like I don't have a 70% win rate Um over time it's usually between like 55 and 65
1:26:24
So let's just say even if you have a 70% win rate the odds that you go on at least a three losing streak is a 93%
1:26:31
chance And as you can see like most people fall in this 60% or lower region of win rate and you can be extremely
1:26:37
profitable with that And if you look like how many times do you see in this chart that somebody has a 100% chance of
1:26:43
going on a losing streak It's okay It's normal It's just about how you protect yourself and when to press the gas and
1:26:50
when to pull back And if you don't have a system for how to manage risk nothing else that you do matters No amount of
1:26:56
net analysis nothing matters if you can't manage risk Okay So I'm going to walk you through the components of
1:27:01
proper risk management which is dynamic position sizing daily loss limits and
1:27:06
trailing stops But I'm also going to show you how to take it further using something that you have never seen before that absolutely no one in the
1:27:14
public has access to Now when it comes to risk management there are two pillars Number one is position sizing and the
1:27:19
other is your rules or how much you'll allow yourself to lose Like position sizing is how much you can lose on one
1:27:25
trade Rules are more like how much will you allow yourself to lose in one day So there are two different things and if
1:27:31
you get one of them wrong the entire system breaks So I want to show you how this works step by step and how to build
1:27:36
a plan that's customized for you and how to make it work for you instead of against you cuz most people's risk
1:27:41
management works against them So we're going to go through three different ways of doing this Now the first is beginner level Now whenever you're new the
1:27:48
priority isn't really about making money It's just about surviving okay Like you're just still trying to build your
1:27:53
edge not leverage your edge So sure size very small and you can risk the same
1:27:59
amount per trade It's totally fine to do that if you're just risking like like let's say if you're you're not profitable yet go buy a very cheap uh
1:28:06
prop firm account something that's like super cheap barely risk anything like trade one micro contract on it and just
1:28:12
do the same thing every time because your goal isn't even making money your goal is just to like limit loss Okay so that's fine to do that when you're a
1:28:18
total beginner because it's about surviving staying consistent and figuring out where your weaknesses are
1:28:23
in the market However once you're at an intermediate level and now you're able to adjust size based on probability then
1:28:30
you can actually start to say okay well I have a lot of data showing this is a high probability setup And and I'll show
1:28:36
you guys how to determine between these but let's just say you have a setup that is higher probability than the other
1:28:41
Like for me for example let's say I come into the market and I am looking to lean
1:28:46
bullish and there's high red folder news So then I know there's a high probability that we're going to be very
1:28:52
volatile If I see a move into a low because if I'm bullish I want to see a move into a low and then I see multiple
1:28:59
confirmations I'm going to go heavier in that trade than let's just say if there was no red folder news and I got just
1:29:07
one confirmation and there wasn't a big move you know I'm not going to treat those two trades the same Now every
1:29:12
trade still follows structure but your sizing reflects your conviction in the trade This is where you get into the
1:29:18
phase of trading where you're an intermediate and you're still learning to trust your edge without overstepping it Now once you guys get to an expert
1:29:24
level and I have no doubt that each and every one of you who doesn't give up and who goes through and does the boring
1:29:29
work and takes data on your trades you'll get to this point At this time you're going to understand a little bit
1:29:35
about how to size your positions with not only data but intuition And some people don't want to admit this Like
1:29:40
look any trader you look up to including me there are times when you know when to put your foot on the gas a little harder
1:29:45
than others Okay I'm not here to hold you guys and tell you guys like scouts honor We're all just risking 1% No Like
1:29:52
people risk heavier at times okay Depends on the market conditions It depends on what setup it is Depends on
1:29:58
how many confluences you have This is where you're going to press the gas a little bit harder And then also you're
1:30:03
going to know when to really limit risk Like there's a lot of times where I'll just throw one contract on something as a feeler position because I look at it
1:30:09
and say "Okay like let's just say if you're in a trade and there's a really tight stop-loss but you have a very far
1:30:16
target right I might just throw one contract on because I'm not going to lose much if it does hit the stop but if
1:30:22
it works out I can get a very big win But I don't need a lot of size to capitalize on a move like this." And
1:30:28
I'll show you guys some examples of this here in a second Now risk management is a problem for so many traders that I literally built a tool to solve this
1:30:34
which is Enigma software Now to be clear this is not something I sell It is not a
1:30:40
public subscription model This is literally for my private team of traders But what it does is it runs your trade
1:30:45
data and tells you exactly how to structure your sizing for the best odds of long-term consistency This removes
1:30:51
the emotion and the guesswork is just backed by math Now again I do not open this up to the public I'm not trying to
1:30:58
turn this into some subscription product So please do not ask Now look guys it doesn't matter if you have risk management if you know all the concepts
1:31:04
you've learned today It none nothing matters Literally nothing I've taught you matters if you don't have a way to
1:31:10
bring it all together So what I want to show you is what I like to call the all-in-one strategy Now this ties
1:31:15
everything from your prep to your execution to your trade management to how you mark key levels to every last
1:31:22
thing you're doing It's going to tie in everything together Now I don't want you guys to sit around and guess which concepts are better or which fair value
1:31:28
gaps to use or which ones not to use because you need to have a system that makes the decisions for you This is the
1:31:35
same exact strategy that I used to make the $46,000 that I made over the last couple weeks to make millions of dollars
1:31:41
in my trading career And this is exactly how I trade today I'm going to give you everything right here right now It is a
1:31:48
simple mechanical strategy that is built to remove stress And stress is what
1:31:53
makes you stupid and what causes you to make all the mistakes that keep you unprofitable You are about to learn the
1:31:59
model that has helped hundreds of unprofitable traders turn into consistently successful traders All
1:32:04
right guys So step one of the strategy is going to be how we mark our key
1:32:10
levels Now like I've told you guys before everything comes down to key levels and confirmations And you have to
1:32:16
have a mechanical way of doing both things Otherwise you just start picking random levels So on this day what you're
1:32:22
going to do is you're going to mark out the previous day's high and the previous day's low Now I did this on the daily
1:32:28
chart by just marking the high and low of the previous daily candle Next you're going to go to the 15minute time frame
1:32:35
Now once you're on the 15-minute time frame you're going to go over here to the left You're going to click this dropown and get the vertical line tool
1:32:41
You're then going to mark out midnight You're going to mark out 6:00 a.m And these are all New York or Eastern
1:32:48
Standard Time Okay very important that these are New York time And then you're going to mark out 6 p.m the previous day
1:32:54
So what you've just marked again like I told you guys earlier is the Asia and the London session So what you'd want to
1:33:00
do is you'd mark out the highs and the lows of this And if you notice the Asia high had already been traded into in
1:33:05
this example and so had the low It was right here on this candle And then you would want to mark out the London low
1:33:11
And if you notice it hasn't been traded into Now the London high had been traded into So the key here is you want to just
1:33:17
pay attention to the levels that haven't been traded into and you want to wait until 9:00 a.m to mark out these levels
1:33:23
Now we're not going to be trading until 9:30 a.m So what I want to do is fast
1:33:28
forward to this next candle Now a lot of you guys right here you're sitting there thinking "Oh my god I got a trade I
1:33:35
missed the trade." And you feel like you've missed the daily move because the market's already traded into one of your levels which is the previous daily high
1:33:42
But now let's get into step two Now step two is confirmation Now I want to be
1:33:48
very clear that you don't always have to catch the top and the bottom and that there are numerous trades you can take on any given day And this strategy
1:33:55
happens every single day So there is an abundance of trades You don't have to worry about missing trades or feel like
1:34:02
you have to catch the perfect move Now let me break this down step by step Now as we've talked about before there are
1:34:07
two types of confirmation And if we're using the 15-minute to mark these levels which are these timebased levels you're
1:34:12
going to go down to the one minute chart Now look what we have here Now we've talked about all of this We have a fair
1:34:18
value gap that got inverted because remember as the market's trading up to these levels we look at these levels as
1:34:23
high probability reversal zones So we're going to look for two things to confirm whether or not the level is going to
1:34:29
reverse or if it's going to flip This level has shown us that it's likely to reverse because we got an inverse fair
1:34:36
value gap and we got a change in the state of delivery However our rules don't let us trade at this time So you
1:34:41
wouldn't take this trade And there's going to be a lot of times that you sit out but trust me it makes your win rate
1:34:46
much higher to wait for the New York session to open Now this is on NASDAQ but this works in any market So as you
1:34:53
can see right here it is 929 which means we'd be waiting one more one minute candle Now you might be getting FOMO
1:35:00
here and this is where whenever I used to trade I would have been in shambles I would have felt like oh my god I'm missing out I would just start FOMOing
1:35:07
into trades not having anywhere to put my stop And this is why most people stay unprofitable because they have all these
1:35:12
concepts They say "Oh well I have the market telling me it's going from one direction to the other." And the truth
1:35:18
is yes at this time you've identified that this level which is that previous daily high is likely to hold meaning
1:35:24
we're going to go to the next level which is that London low the low of the London session Okay So right here we
1:35:31
know that this is the move that's at hand But like I've told you guys what do you want to see inside this move in
1:35:37
order to get a trade What you need to see is a run on liquidity You do not
1:35:42
enter a trade unless there's a run on liquidity So what you're waiting to see happen is a short-term point of
1:35:49
structure get ran against you Bonus if it occurs into a fair value gap because
1:35:55
we see the market's displacing You see how everything's tying together The market's hit one of your key levels It's
1:36:00
shown you that it's moving down to the downside We're displacing through lows And now what we're going to look for is
1:36:07
this simple pattern You're going to look for a sweep of any structure against you
1:36:12
And then we want to see confirmation that this is going to go further So what
1:36:17
kind of confirmation do we look for The same thing we used up here Either an inverted fair value gap or a change in
1:36:23
the state of delivery So if we see what happens right after this boom you get a
1:36:28
change in the state of delivery Now again what is a change in the state of delivery Well we went from engulfing this down candle with an uplose candle
1:36:35
to an immediate downlo candle engulfing this candle So this down candle engulfing the bullish candle shows us
1:36:42
that all the buyers here are now trapped And this was a sharp move that was just to manipulate traders So what is
1:36:49
happening above highs Again this ties back to everything I've been teaching this entire video Cannot stress enough
1:36:54
how everything comes together We've got a fair value gap We've got the market coming above a high And as I said before
1:37:00
the way the market reacts to highs and lows tells you everything you need to know We're reacting to a high in a way
1:37:06
that shows us that large market participants are using this as liquidity So once you see this in context that
1:37:11
we're moving away from that previous daily high and into that London low anytime you see this pattern you can
1:37:17
take a trade Now just because this level got hit pre-market that doesn't necessarily matter because we've
1:37:22
identified the market's moving from this level to the next So at this time anytime you get this kind of entry confirmation and I'm going to show you
1:37:28
guys numerous examples so don't worry You can enter the trade If you wanted to have an aggressive stop-loss you could
1:37:34
put it right there or you could put it at the candle bodies or you could put it at the high I almost always use the
1:37:40
candle bodies because it gives you a little bit better risk-to-reward if you're scalping Now if I take the first
1:37:45
trade like the first reversal I'll put the stop at the high and I'll show you an example of that here in a little bit
1:37:50
But right here in this example I would have just put my stops at the candle bodies And to be clear guys you might be
1:37:56
thinking "Oh well how do you determine?" It's not like the end of the world okay It doesn't make that much of a difference for me It's just if I'm
1:38:02
taking the trades that are in between the levels I'm usually more aggressive with my risk management because I look
1:38:07
at these trades like I don't want them to really move against me The move's already happening It shouldn't come back
1:38:12
up and even get close to this body or it's likely to go to the wick Then if I'm in this trade I understand that I
1:38:18
have a lot of room to run So I might be a little bit more liberal with my stop-loss placement So at this time what
1:38:24
you would do is then execute the trade You would put your stop up there and you could put your target down at this low
1:38:31
Now you might be thinking that this is a low risk-to-reward I take trades that are all the way down to 1.5 because this
1:38:36
strategy has such a high win rate Now there are more opportunities to be had on this day So let me break this down
1:38:42
We're targeting the London low So let's see what happens Well the market trades into the London low Now let's see what
1:38:49
happens next Because as we've traded into this London low then what Well you see a change in the state of delivery So
1:38:56
as soon as you get that change in the state of delivery that's telling you the London low is likely going to reverse
1:39:01
It's it's this right here is showing you a bullish reaction to this London low Now to be clear you wouldn't look at
1:39:07
every single change in the state of delivery You're just looking at the ones in context So right here we've hit the level that now that this uplo candle is
1:39:14
engulfing this down close candle at this time you're good to go and you can just go ahead and take a long Now you would
1:39:19
have taken it on the close of this candle You could put your stop since this is from a key level You could put
1:39:24
your stop at the nearest swing low because again like I said before when you're trading the actual reversal or
1:39:31
the reaction to a level you can be a little bit more liberal with your stop Now where would you look to take this
1:39:36
trade Well in this example you would just look to take it up to the high of the session because we've already taken
1:39:42
out this timebased level and this is the closest level to you Now I want you guys to pay very close attention because this
1:39:47
is where most traders unravel So let's just say you entered the market right here You put your target up here and you
1:39:54
put your stop loss down here under that low Well what do we see happen Oh wow
1:40:00
This is amazing We're getting up moves Yeah everything is good And this is where most of you guys get really
1:40:05
excited and you like "Oh wow Uh-oh Now what?" Well now most of you
1:40:10
guys are taking loss and you think "Oh my god the world's ending." However you could have saved yourself from this loss
1:40:17
Now the way that you would have saved yourself from this loss is the same way you entered the trade because if we're seeing like for example if we see the
1:40:24
market changing the state of delivery right here and that makes us take a long but you immediately see the market give
1:40:29
you a bearish change in the state of delivery right there you can cut that trade at your entry Now this is the flip
1:40:35
logic because again I look at the market like if we came to this London low right This this level is a London low If you
1:40:41
came to this level and the market gave you everything you'd want to see to see a bullish reaction and it gave you a
1:40:47
little bit of momentum and then what happens Sellers aggressively step in Now this is where most people unravel They
1:40:52
say "Oh my god I can't believe it that the strategy doesn't work." But this is where I just pivot and say "Okay this is
1:40:58
the market's way of telling me there's a new opportunity." Because if this level's going to fail if that level is
1:41:04
not going to hold guess what Guess where we're going The next level which in this example is the previous daily low So
1:41:10
instead of sitting there crying about how I took a loss I'm going to actually look to take another trade because I
1:41:17
don't care about bias I don't care about being right or wrong I'm not really expecting if this market is going to
1:41:22
flip this level or if it's going to reverse from it I'm just going by what the candles tell me So the candles told
1:41:28
me it was going to go long Then it flipped So let's just say even if you did take the loss right here and you hesitated at this time you could then
1:41:35
take a short Now remember we've already won one trade So you're still up a little bit on this day And this is all just trading one NASDAQ contract So
1:41:41
let's just say you're going to put your stops up at this high because again this is a trade at the level and then you
1:41:46
target down at this level down here Now that's a good risk-to-reward But a lot of traders they're in shambles because
1:41:52
they took a loss So they hesitate and they don't execute here because maybe they they said it was against their plan
1:41:58
or they felt like they're overtrading But truth be told guys you got to understand that the market is is just
1:42:03
going to give you information If a level fails that is the market's way of telling you this isn't it this isn't where we're going to reverse We're going
1:42:09
to go to the next level So at that time you would be able to execute the trade and target the next timebased level So
1:42:16
let's see how this trade played out Now the market moves down to the downside and you'll see a couple different times
1:42:22
where the market will give you the same pattern that we talked about for trailing your stops So I want you to
1:42:27
take a look at this and see if you can find it without me telling you Yes if you guessed right here then you were
1:42:33
correct Now if you didn't see it you have to understand remember the whole thing about this strategy Once we've hit
1:42:39
a level and you're like let's say if you're bearish you want to see highs get ran and then that move continued Anytime
1:42:46
that swing highs get ran in a bearish momentum you're asking yourself how are reacting to highs and lows If you're
1:42:51
manipulating highs that's a stop run So right here look what happened We manipulated a high So if that happens
1:42:58
you can then bring your stops up And this allows you to be much more aggressive with your risk management
1:43:03
than just leaving your stops all the way up here And the way you protect your bankroll is everything in this business
1:43:09
guys And once you realize that you can move your stops up quicker than you may have thought a lot of the edge comes off
1:43:14
from losing Just like whenever you realize that whenever you lose a trade often times there's another opportunity
1:43:20
Then you don't really care so much about losing Now of course you need to make sure that you have a loss limit for the
1:43:26
day So personally I don't like taking more than two losses in a single day But if I just take one loss almost always
1:43:33
I'll be able to find another trade where I can not only make back that loss but make back even more Like this example
1:43:39
right here Now this was a day that I actually traded I'm picking this example showing you guys something that I
1:43:44
actually traded Now if you look right here $3,410 off just one NASDAQ contract Just
1:43:50
one This isn't overrisisking This isn't going into some crazy position sizing It's not using a bunch of daily bias
1:43:56
It's a simple repeatable strategy where you mark out levels evaluate your responses to the levels and execute Now
1:44:02
let's take a look at another example Now this was just last week You can see April 10 2025 and I made 6,000 bucks on
1:44:10
this trade Now I was trading micros because the market was crazy I mean this is like the Trump tariff era where
1:44:16
there's like 100.5 minute candles So I was trading micros I just traded five which is like half of a mini Now I'm
1:44:22
trading my personal account I'm not trading a prop firm It's the broker statement I showed you guys earlier But let's break down this trade and how I
1:44:28
made 6,000 bucks trading this exact strategy All right so this is the 15-minute chart 9:00 a.m on that day So
1:44:34
in this example the previous daily high and previous daily low were nowhere around but you still would want to mark those levels So I'm going to mark out
1:44:41
the Asia high which was right there So this was the Asia high We can go ahead and put our template on So that reads
1:44:47
that that's the Asia high Then right here we have the London low Now the Asia low had already been taken out here The
1:44:53
London high was also preserved right there So we can go ahead and mark these out That way you know exactly what
1:44:59
levels to trade Now I was looking at this example and I said "Okay I want to
1:45:04
see," and this is how you'd map a scenario out So I'm going to say "Okay look I'm not really you know stuck on a
1:45:10
bias If the market moves all the way up here and then it reverses I'll trade down to the London low If the market
1:45:16
moves all the way up here and then it gives me a flip pattern cool I'll trade to the Asia high If the market trades
1:45:22
here and reverses I'll trade up higher Or if the market trades right here and gives me a flip I'll trade lower Notice
1:45:28
how many different opportunities I'm willing to take I'm not stuck in one idea or picky or saying the market has
1:45:34
to play out in some way that I've just predicted every mark You'll see these guys they'll draw lines on the chart of
1:45:40
what's going to happen for the day It's like that's cute I don't really give a what happens I just care about what is a repeatable process that I can
1:45:46
actually follow where I'm not overthinking everything I do Because whenever I was trading whenever I was in the same position you guys are in right
1:45:52
now all I would do is overthink everything I'd mark out a hundred different levels and watch videos and
1:45:58
wonder why one fair value gap worked and why the other one did and all this stuff And it it's just not a practical way of doing things So once you understand how
1:46:04
to mark out levels only then will you have a consistent way of trading because confirmations are nothing without key
1:46:10
levels and key levels are nothing without confirmations So let's go ahead and break this down how I took this
1:46:16
trade So as you can see right here this is 914 So moving into the market we see a little bit of movement around and then
1:46:23
what happens Then we trade down into this London low So I also took a loss on
1:46:29
this day I want to break down how I took a loss and turn this into a winning day So what do you see right here Well we
1:46:35
traded down into that level and then we took a inverted fair value gap right there So at this time I said "Okay cool
1:46:43
I'm gonna take a long right here." And then I put my stops down here Now what I wanted to target was all the way up here
1:46:49
at this London high So I said "Okay cool This looks like a great trade We'll take a buy We'll put my stop loss down here."
1:46:57
And I target up here So I was watching the market Got a little bit of price action Just sitting around waiting
1:47:04
seeing what we're going to get Now the market started to move up a little bit right here And I thought "Okay wow This
1:47:10
is great." Now to be clear I was up about half this cuz remember I took micros Micros five micros is half of one
1:47:17
mini You got think like micros is onetenth of the mini So so basically I
1:47:22
was in half the position size you see here I just want to be transparent Um and as soon as I saw this right here most of you guys are just trembling And
1:47:28
I know that myself when I used to trade I'd be like "Oh my god what's going on I thought this was going to work." You know you're panicking But I look at this
1:47:35
like "Okay cool." Like great I actually now have a really good trade because now the market came into this London low It
1:47:42
did it gave every chance right Like buyers stepped in We started to invert fair value gaps I mean everything you'd
1:47:47
want to see to be bullish and then it just said "Nope one candle erased most of it." So we got not only did we get a
1:47:53
change in the state of delivery right here we also had ran a high So at this point I just exited the trade I said "Cool I'm going to take a loss." And
1:48:01
immediately immediately at that time the market is giving you feedback saying you are wrong The market's likely to trade
1:48:08
down lower Now we'll go into where I took my profit at in a second because you'll notice there's no other key
1:48:14
levels based on time But this goes back into the list of levels that I gave you earlier So I took that loss which was
1:48:20
very minor Now notice how much I was able to shave off I barely took a fraction of the loss that I could have taken if I would have just held my trade
1:48:27
And that's why it's important to have a mechanical way of knowing when you're wrong So at this time I entered another trade put my stop loss up at this level
1:48:34
right here and then I put my takeprofit way down here Now I want to go to the higher time frames and show you guys
1:48:40
what happens So I'm going to remove that because it'll just automatically hit If I do replay it'll like print the big
1:48:45
time frame candles So if I go to the 4 hour right here what do you see in this big fair value gap We talked about this
1:48:51
very early on in the video Now I want you to really think about this What do you see inside this fair value gap that
1:48:57
could be a level that we would trade into if we don't have anything else Now if you didn't guess it's this inflection
1:49:03
point So I want to show you guys a way you can manage your trade in terms of letting it run and getting higher
1:49:09
risk-to-reward once you have extended targets like this Because on these days it was very volatile I was thinking okay
1:49:15
we could get a big move I'm just going to open my trade and I'm going to watch it and I'm not going to you know
1:49:21
mechanically take profit but we'll watch at this level right here to see how we react to it So just like we watched the
1:49:26
the London low or any other level to get a reaction I'm just going to mark that as a possible area that I could take
1:49:33
profit is down here at this area right here Just like we're watching this London low right Like the the market's telling us right here it was bullish
1:49:39
failed So I say "Okay market had every chance to be bullish it failed I'm going to take a sell." So I let this market
1:49:45
run a little bit and we started to get some really big momentum I was I was loving it You know at this time these
1:49:51
are those trades you're really happy but you got to watch them because they will turn back on you a little bit and you have to have a mechanical way of making
1:49:57
sure you trail up stops at the right time Now notice right here when we came above this high we kind of push through
1:50:03
it So there's no reason to trail up stops at this high right here But if you notice right here we came up there hit
1:50:10
that Now here is where you trail up stop So at that time I moved my stops up I've
1:50:15
removed a lot of risk at this point Now I'm just going to let this thing run And boy did this trade run This was an
1:50:21
amazing trade Like as you saw $6,000 off trading micros Now for those of you who are newer may not appreciate that but
1:50:27
that's a lot of money to make off micros So I want to be clear of how I took profits on this trade Now whenever we
1:50:34
talk about letting a trade run and getting higher risk reward and trading with a little bit of discretion one
1:50:39
strategy that I like to use that I came up with after getting sick of having trades return to my you know my entry or
1:50:46
not being able to take profit at the right time a big thing that I used to have that was a problem was I would take
1:50:52
profits at a level and the market would just run way past it And I know that some of you guys go through that So this
1:50:57
is going to change that forever and solve that issue once and for all And and this simple change is probably going to make a lot of you guys profitable And
1:51:04
it's these light little things where you increase your average risk-to-reward or increase your average win size that will
1:51:09
be the light bulb in your career It's not like some holy grail strategy that is $100 RR It's usually something pretty
1:51:15
boring that's been hidden under your nose the entire time Now this is called price waiting Okay price waiting is once
1:51:21
you hit into a key level where you would usually take profit you're just going to trail up your stop to highs along the
1:51:28
way So in this example like once we hit into this level I want to see what happens Do we form another swing high
1:51:34
and push past it So I had trailed my stop up to this high right here and I
1:51:39
said "Okay let's just see if this market can run a little bit." Because once the market really starts running past a
1:51:44
level a lot of times you can get a lot more out of the trade than just taking profit at a level Like for example if
1:51:50
the market's expanding don't just take profits at whatever level you think see if that level gets ran through because
1:51:56
there's a decent chance that it will And then once the market creates this structure on your entry time frame which
1:52:01
for me is the one minute you want to then keep trailing your stop up right And you'll be able to get a lot better
1:52:08
riskreward And you'll notice how it's crazy how well this works I mean you'll you'll go go and back test this It's
1:52:14
it's like your stop will act as a shield It's insane how well this works And it's so simple It's so so so
1:52:21
simple Now one thing I like to do too is like literally every time that you form a swing low you want to move your stops
1:52:28
up again I mean not a swing low a swing high in this example If you were in a long it'd be a swing low But see how
1:52:33
much more we've gotten Now this trade it was a decent trade already It was like already five R But by doing this I made
1:52:40
that trade an 8R trade And if you guys were even able to do this to like half your wins like for example if imagine if
1:52:47
like half the wins that you took half the wins you were able to do this you
1:52:52
would be profitable because half of your wins would be so much larger and that would outweigh the losses you have Now
1:52:58
look right here You can see for me it was 6,000 bucks because I traded micros and I think I got a little bit worse of
1:53:05
an entry but it was close enough as you can see And this strategy is literally
1:53:10
what changed everything for me because once you are objective to things once you're not so fearful to take a loss and
1:53:15
instead you look at a loss as a new opportunity not only do you have a winning mindset in trading now you're just thinking like a winner in general
1:53:22
And trust me if you want to win at a business where 90% of people fail you have to be a beast You have to
1:53:27
think like a winner in general You have to get out of this fear mindset where you're afraid of everything You're afraid of losing You want everything to
1:53:33
be perfect And you'll never be successful as long as you trade like that Now price rating was also a really big thing for me that helped me make way
1:53:41
more money because I sat there and looked at my data and realized damn like almost all the trades I win go further
1:53:47
than my target Now of course you don't want to just let your trades run forever and risk them turning back So let your
1:53:52
stop loss be your take-profit Trail up that stop-loss and let the market run Give it a little bit of room Don't be
1:53:59
afraid And sometimes it'll turn back on you That's okay But the times that it doesn't is going to outweigh those times
1:54:05
heavily Trust me guys and go and test this on your own trading Go back and look at some of your trades And if you
1:54:10
don't have a journal use a journal from the study guide And after a couple trades look at your winners and see just
1:54:15
how much further they ran without you Now with your study guide or if you signed up for the study guide before the course I'm going to send you a full
1:54:22
diagram You're going to get this whole board that goes over everything and breaks down literally every last step of
1:54:27
this strategy Now the results this strategy have given me is insane And the results that it's given other traders is
1:54:33
crazy too I want to be clear they're not typical and past performance is not an indicator of future results Trading
1:54:39
involves substantial risk and nothing shown here guarantees that you're going to be profitable Okay this is a
1:54:45
disclaimer I have to tell you guys that But now I want to show you what's possible using this strategy This is one
1:54:51
trader who is just like you Take a look at Jaden in April of last year Literally almost exactly a year ago He didn't even
1:54:58
realize how the prop firm process works He was like "Oh I'm up 3K How do I make how do I pass a challenge?" He was
1:55:04
unaware of the properform process and he was at a loss of $80,000 before he started using this strategy Now fast
1:55:10
forward just to December of last year He had made $270,000 in profit Now he did this
1:55:16
trading the exact strategy you're looking at If you want to talk to Jaden go follow him on Instagram You've seen
1:55:22
me in my vlogs I literally flew him out to Miami to celebrate We had cigars It was sick Now I'm not saying that this is
1:55:27
going to happen overnight but I'm showing you guys what is possible if you really take this serious You don't have to go out and trade some complicated
1:55:34
strategy Now I made this video with one goal to create thousands of profitable traders Now if you're serious about
1:55:40
making that happen this year I opened up limited slots for my direct mentorship I
1:55:46
want to be clear this is intensive It's not for everyone I trade live with you Every trade you take gets reviewed Again
1:55:52
it's not for everyone It's only for people who are serious Now if you want to apply then go ahead and use the link in the description to apply for my
1:55:58
mentorship All right guys Now I want to tie this in with the most important part of this entire thing that I'm teaching
1:56:04
you guys today which is the mental game of trading Cuz everybody knows that if you can't get over psychology literally
1:56:10
nothing I just taught you mattered So I'm going to show you exactly how after years and years of suffering and pain
1:56:16
that I overcame the mental game of trading Now this gets me emotional So I want you guys to stick with me for just a second So I know a lot of you
1:56:22
guys are watching this and you have this massive dopamine spike you you've learned this new strategy and you think
1:56:27
"Oh I'm going to be profitable." Well the answer is most of you are wrong And you might be thinking "What what you just taught me this strategy I I have
1:56:34
the best strategy." Look guys that's not it The reason that you haven't been profitable up to this point isn't just
1:56:39
because your strategy It is because of you It's because of that voice in your head that tells you to close your trades
1:56:45
early It tells you to overtrade Tells you to break your rules It tells you to do all the dumb that keeps you unprofitable And if you don't change
1:56:51
that if you don't fix that then trust me guys it doesn't matter Like it doesn't matter what you learn you'll never be
1:56:56
successful in trading or in anything Now I want to talk to you guys about something that I don't even really like
1:57:02
talking about but I know that there are younger versions of myself There are other people who are at rock bottom
1:57:07
There are a lot of people that could benefit from this So look guys like many of you know this already I have a video
1:57:12
on my channel but when I came into trading I didn't come into trading with a clean slate I I I had a background I
1:57:18
got in trouble for selling weed I was facing prison Like trading was my only option guys I was so down and depressed
1:57:25
I literally had nothing I had lost everything I was a just I was a different person And yes now it's all
1:57:31
great I've turned my life around I live an amazing life But I would be at a disservice to sit here and just sell you
1:57:37
this lifestyle like this has always been this way cuz it hasn't My life sucked When I was learning how to
1:57:42
trade I had nobody I didn't think it was going to work I honestly wondered if I
1:57:47
was just gambling my money away And for a long time I was for many years But it
1:57:52
doesn't have to be that way So guys I want you to pay close attention to what the I'm about to tell you And take this from somebody who was literally
1:57:59
delivering hamburgers door dashing to fund a $100 trading account to getting where I'm at today making
1:58:05
millions of dollars retiring my parents taking care of my family and friends doing whatever I want to do I didn't get
1:58:11
here just from some chart strategy Okay guys I cannot be more clear about that That you have to be
1:58:17
enabled to beat yourself in order to make this work And whenever I was failing I was failing from overtrading
1:58:22
from greed from hesitation from all of it Like I was failing from all of the different things It wasn't just one But
1:58:28
all of those things stem back to one simple thing that I kept trying to solve by watching trading psychology videos or
1:58:34
or watching a podcast or or meditating or running or doing all these things that I overlooked the most simple
1:58:41
way to overcome this the entire time You see while I had to realize that yes emotions are against you in trading
1:58:48
right like they will make you fail You have to overcome fear You have to overcome all these things But the biggest thing that I see you guys mess
1:58:54
up is the same thing that I mess up and the same thing that all traders mess up when they're unprofitable You're placing
1:58:59
all this importance on making this work And if it doesn't work if you don't win the trade if you don't win the day if
1:59:06
you blow the funded account if you lose all these things you're so scared of these situations that guess
1:59:12
what Everybody you look up to every single person that you look up to went through these things I lost everything I
1:59:19
lost everything multiple times And I'm not saying it has to be that way In fact it doesn't You do not have to lose
1:59:25
everything I can't be more clear on that But guys you can't be so hard on yourself whenever you lose You have to
1:59:30
understand you're going to go through these things You're going to to lose an account You're going to lose a funded account You're going to blow it It's
1:59:36
okay It's going to happen So go ahead and accept that it's going to happen and remove this importance from trading
1:59:42
because anytime you put so much importance on something anytime you say this has to work or I have to get uh be
1:59:48
successful in 3 months or I have to show my parents that I'm going to be a successful trader or I I I won't be able
1:59:54
to quit my job until I'm profitable for a year So if I'm not profitable and you just start unraveling and you place all
2:00:00
this importance on things and you're failing before you even begin Now I could tell you stuff that's like filler like back test your trades and journal
2:00:07
and you know risk management That's all common sense Okay Yes you do have to do those things But guys you do not have to
2:00:14
go down the path that I went down I went through years and years It was four years Four years until I was
2:00:21
consistently profitable I started trading in 2016 after I got lucky in crypto Traded off and on and I made
2:00:27
hundreds of thousands getting lucky and lost everything Do you realize what that did to my mind Do you realize how long
2:00:33
it took me to get over that kind of trauma those kind of mistakes that I made over and over and over and over a
2:00:39
again guys Like if you're not careful it will turn into a multi-year battle And if that happens if you're in
2:00:45
that valley of despair don't give up I'm not saying that's all bad But guys if you're not if you're watching this and
2:00:51
you're somebody who just started trading in the last year or last two years and you you haven't hit that rock bottom yet
2:00:57
trust me I want you to understand it doesn't have to be that way Like whenever I was by myself trading I
2:01:03
didn't have anybody This was before the days of Discord before the days of all these different education things and
2:01:08
mentors I didn't have anybody I would have literally given anything just to have a friend who traded much less
2:01:15
somebody who could teach me much less somebody who could hold my hand and actually take me through what it meant
2:01:20
to be a trader to sit there look over my shoulder correct my mistakes when I'm wrong all these things Like I would have
2:01:26
given anything to do that And that is why today I made this I made this whole project I worked my ass off of this for
2:01:32
weeks to do this for free so I could show you guys all the information I wish I would have had And I appreciate you
2:01:38
guys for taking the time to make it through this whole thing However long it's been I don't know I feel like it's been all day long So for you guys who
2:01:44
watch all the way to the end I appreciate you I I greatly greatly appreciate you And I I haven't forgot
2:01:50
there's a giveaway I'm going to tell you exactly how to enter that here soon But I just want you guys first of all to
2:01:56
know I appreciate you But understand like how blessed you are Like how ble I wish that I would have had me as a
2:02:01
mentor I wish that whenever I was started trading I had somebody that was like this who would tell me straight
2:02:07
who's not just going to tell me "Oh you're going to get rich overnight." Cuz you're not Okay You're not You're not going to get rich overnight
2:02:14
And if you understand that yes trading is hard It's going to be really hard guys If you just know how to zoom
2:02:20
out remove the importance from things and understand that it really is a process Like you need to understand how
2:02:26
to journal your trades look at where you're losing what times a day you're losing and really zoom out and not care
2:02:31
about anything Cuz like whenever I became profitable it wasn't because I learned much new stuff It was because I
2:02:38
took away things I took away things from my trading I was able to look at my journal and say "Okay now I'm going to
2:02:43
be be looking at this with a sensible mindset I'm not worried about being profitable I'm just worried about perfecting my process." So I started to
2:02:49
realize like "Oh these times a day I'm not as profitable This type of trading strategy is not as profitable." when I
2:02:54
have daily bias I'm not as profitable right And I wouldn't have been able to see these things if I had all my focus
2:03:00
on just making money or or trying to make this work overnight But nobody ever told me that So be thankful Like I'm
2:03:05
telling you that right now Like this video I've told you so much stuff that most people they don't want to say
2:03:11
because it makes it sound you know it's it's not like it doesn't sound sexy It doesn't sound like it's going to sell a
2:03:16
course And that's why I don't sell a course The only thing I have is a mentorship Now if you guys want to work directly with me look I'm sorry guys
2:03:23
Like there's a lot of you guys that I probably won't be able to work with There's no way on earth that I can work with hundreds of thousands of people But
2:03:29
if you want to work directly with me if you want to have me watch over your shoulder if you want to sit with me while I'm trading live executing on my
2:03:36
screen if you want every single trade that you take reviewed if you want to have your own version of my
2:03:41
riskmanagement software literally everything then apply down in the description And I I cannot help every
2:03:46
one of you guys Okay Now if you apply and you don't get accepted I'll still send you a free gift So make sure to put
2:03:51
your email in correctly put your phone number in correctly we'll still send you stuff I'll still I still want you to win
2:03:56
And to be clear like I've given you all the information here today The only thing that I I sell is how to execute
2:04:02
that And yes I do sell it cuz I value my time A lot of people don't like that That's fine They just keep watching stuff for free on YouTube But for those
2:04:08
of you who want to take this to the next level who are going to be serious go ahead and apply and be be crystal clear
2:04:14
Be honest on your application Because if you're not serious about this if you're not ready to really take everything you
2:04:20
have and put it into trading then I don't want to work with you Cuz I don't work with people who aren't serious Because I very very very highly value my
2:04:28
clients results And that's why you see all the crazy results for my community like you see where Brick just got
2:04:33
approved for a 40k payout and he's not only up 40k he was up 120K across all
2:04:39
his accounts And then like I talked about Jaden earlier where he literally went from being at a loss of 80K to now
2:04:45
he's made way more than 270K This was just December of last year And here are all of his payouts using the same
2:04:51
strategy that I taught you guys today but he's actually trading it with me And if you watch the vlog where I flew him
2:04:57
out he said that the thing that helped him the most it wasn't even the strategy It was him journaling It was him becoming a better version of himself Now
2:05:04
if you want to follow his journey or talk to him and ask him about this go follow on Instagram The dude's living life This is an amazing dude Really good
2:05:11
friend of mine I highly recommend you give him a follow Or you have Jasmine who joined August 27th and in December
2:05:16
not even 4 months later she got a $36,000 payout and was number one on Tops's leaderboard And you have tons of
2:05:23
other traders actually getting consistent payouts It's not just posting a bunch of prop firm funded certificates
2:05:28
where people just get funded and blow the account because we actually implement what it takes to be a
2:05:34
successful trader Because once you cut through the noise guys you realize that this stuff is possible I firmly believe
2:05:40
any of you guys who have made it this far you're already ahead of 90% of people Most people click off these
2:05:45
videos in like 2 minutes and then wonder why they don't make any money Because people don't take things seriously This
2:05:50
is the same system that helped Shawn get his first payout after seven years Seven
2:05:56
years And he's now on his track to get his next payout Or you have one of the craziest stories which was Trader Mom
2:06:01
She was literally at home with a newborn and she was struggling Like you guys have no excuse because after this she's
2:06:07
now got to not only where she's making payouts but now she's able to make $6,000 in a single trade Like do you
2:06:14
realize that's lifechanging guys All because she locked in and took this seriously And then you have Kios who is
2:06:19
up 5,600 in a single day plus another 14K that he had a payout on the way Or you had Chong who is brand new and now
2:06:27
he's securing his third payout just a couple of months later And this is not just the traders you see There are tons
2:06:33
and tons of traders who are absolutely crushing it And all of these traders were once in the exact same position you
2:06:39
are in right now The only difference the only difference because they were struggling for months but it was they
2:06:46
changed their mindset They took things serious and they locked in They traded a simple strategy They actually took
2:06:52
everything into their own hands and realized that they are in control just like every single one of you guys is in
2:06:58
control of whether or not you make it in the long game Now of course you might go through struggles You might go through
2:07:03
times where it's not working for you where it feels like it's not going to ever work But you have to never ever
2:07:09
ever lose sight of the goal guys Because this all can be for you too
2:07:15
Literally I believe any one of you watching can do this This is so many traders just like you who were
2:07:20
struggling who are now crushing it So look guys we've went over literally everything This whole course I've taught
2:07:26
